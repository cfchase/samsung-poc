    "### Setup Instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "This demo demonstrates the process of converting raw PDF files into InstructLab Synthetic Knowledge Infusion Data using the RBC POC as an example. Follow these steps to get started with your own data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Steps to Get Started:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Organize Your Documents:**\n",
    "   - Create a new directory under the `document_collection` directory for your specific project. For example, if your project is named \"Samsung,\" your directory structure should look like this:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     |-- document_collection\n",
    "     |   `-- Samsung\n",
    "     |       |-- Samsung_data.pdf\n",
    "     |       `-- qna.yaml\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Place all your PDF files and ICL files (like `qna.yaml`) into this directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Format Your ICLs:**\n",
    "   - Ensure your ICL files contain sufficient context and question-answer pairs. We recommend including at least 5 distinct contexts, each with a minimum of 3 sets of questions and answers. More entries will improve the robustness of your data.\n",
    "    - The ICL file should be in the following format (refer to the `document_collection/Samsung/qna.yaml` file for an example):\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```yaml\n",
    "    domain: \n",
    "    document_outline: A one to two line description of the document\n",
    "    seed_examples:\n",
    "      - context: <context 1 goes here>\n",
    "        question_and_answers:\n",
    "          - question: <question 1 goes here>\n",
    "            answer: <answer 1 goes here>\n",
    "          - question: <question 2 goes here>\n",
    "            answer: <answer 2 goes here>\n",
    "          - question: <question 3 goes here>\n",
    "            answer: <answer 3 goes here>\n",
    "    ... \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Note:** Replace placeholders with actual content relevant to your documents. Ensure the contexts are clear and questions are well-formulated to extract meaningful answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Update the Data Directory Path:**\n",
    "   - In the script or code where the data directory is specified, update the `data_dir` variable to reflect the path to your new directory. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     data_dir = \"document_collection/Samsung\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "4. **Update the Output Directory Path:**\n",
    "   - In the script or code where the data directory is specified, update the `output_dir` variable to reflect the path to your directory. For example:\n",
    "     ```python\n",
    "     data_dir = \"output/Samsung\"\n",
    "     ```\n",
