In the second half, we plan to expand it sequentially to all affiliates, including overseas subsidiaries. For external business, a Vietnamese IT company adopted Brity Works and Copilot, and multiple customers in manufacturing and service industries are expected to adopt it soon. We are also conducting PoCs with 14 customers in industries such as petrochemicals, automotive, and food and beverage, and expect to secure more customers in the second half. Additionally, we plan to expand the business targeting large corporations, finance, and public sectors with high security needs through private cloud offerings.

Regarding the product improvement plans for the second half, we are preparing for enabling the use of Brity Copilot in office programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook.

Meeting Copilot currently supports real-time captions in Korean and English and plans to support 10 languages including Vietnamese and Japanese, and provide offline meeting mode that can distinguish speakers in the same place. This service enhancement will help us secure more use cases, so we expect to drive sales growth in the second half.

We are also developing plug-in functions to integrate corporate work systems with Copilot. We will provide optimized Copilot services for enterprises by linking with major global solutions widely used in companies, such as Workday and Confluence. Thank you.
