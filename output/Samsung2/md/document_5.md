In the public sector, we plan to open the Daegu data center, selected in the first half as a public-private partnership cloud data center, will provide official services in the second half. We will enhance pre-sales efforts targeting public customers demanding high security level and collaborate with public partners to expand our business.

Additionally, we are preparing products and offerings necessary for the business, aiming to complete additional development of FabriX products in Q3 and diversify customized SCP offerings such as Oracle services and cloud DR to support various projects.

We will leverage FabriX as a key differentiating factor for our MSP and CSP businesses and introduce our cloud business to all industries.

We will strive to achieve favorable results in the cloud business in the second half.

This concludes the cloud business presentation.

**Thank you**
