Quarterly Cello Square business sales recorded KRW 285 billion, with domestic sales accounting for 20% and overseas sales for 80%. By region, sales from export-oriented countries, China and Southeast Asia where we opened the services in 2022, have accounted for 43% of the total Cello Square sales, and sales from the Americas and Europe, where we opened the services last year, accounted for 30%.

SDS is now capable of conducting logistics operations in 30 countries globally through Cello Square.

With the capability, we will expand the business by providing services that analyze and optimize customer end-to-end logistics from export countries' factories to import countries' final destinations based on data. We will also strengthen inland transport and warehouse operation services in major destinations, continuously expanding the import logistics business in large consumer markets.

The revenue from generative AI is expected to come from FabriX in the form of PaaS, MSP revenue from implementation, SaaS revenue from Brity Copilot, and GPU server sales. In the first half, the revenue was not significant, but it is expected to be generated mainly in the second half. So we expect the annual revenue to reach the mid-KRW 100 billion range.

## **Q: Seokjin Jang from Kyobo AXA Asset Management**

First, will the increase in Cello Square sales structurally improve the logistics operating profit margin in the future? Secondly, when can we expect overseas SaaS sales to become visible? Thirdly, can you share the company's plans for shareholder returns from our cash holdings?

## **A1: Kooil O, EVP and Logistics Business Division Leader**

One of our goals when we first set up the Cello Square business model and entered the market was to enhance customer service to increase the value that customers perceive and automate operational tasks to improve productivity.
