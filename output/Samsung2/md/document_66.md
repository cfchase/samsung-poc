In the second half, we plan to focus on core system implementation projects in the insurance industry and information system projects using generative AI technology for data analysis and real-time marketing in the second-tier financial sector.

We do not expect the profit margin to be significantly affected by the business we are promoting. We're set to lead the market by providing unique value-added services that distinguish SDS, driven by our expertise in cloud and generative AI technologies.

The CrowdStrike incident is related to security solutions rather than CSP issues. As security solutions are necessary for all companies, it can be an opportunity for CSPs that can manage them well. MSP providers with well-organized procedures and problem-solving capabilities will be highly sought after.

Regarding Brity Copilot, a generative AI product, can you explain the current business status and future prospects?

## **A: Haegoo Song, EVP and Solution Business Division Leader**

To support the implementation of hyper-automation in corporate work, we launched Brity Copilot, a solution integrating generative AI into common work solutions such as mail, messenger, meetings, and document management in Brity Works in April. We are promoting the expansion of the service to Samsung affiliates and external markets after applying it internally in SDS. As of July, about 90,000 employees from Samsung affiliates such as Electronics and C&T are using this service.
