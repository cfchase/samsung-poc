Next is the business direction for the second half. In the second half, we will focus on differentiating our services by providing information services that meet growing customer needs, such as global logistics control services and carbon emissions dashboards, to identify strategic global customers.

Additionally, with the increase in companies relocating production bases from China to Southeast Asia and Mexico due to recent U.S. tariff policies, SDS has strengths in providing logistics services in both regions. We plan to provide end-to-end logistics services which cover from consulting to equipment relocation, materials procurement, and finished product export logistics for customers adjusting their global supply chain networks.

This concludes the presentation on the logistics business. Thank you.

## **Q: Hoyoon Jung from Korea Investment & Securities**

Can you briefly explain the business performance since the launch of FabriX and the business plans for the second half of the year?

## **A: Scott HJ Koo, EVP and Cloud Service Business Division Leader**

We launched FabriX, our enterprise generative AI platform, to support the full spectrum of GenAI service development and use. Since April, we've been actively involved in various internal and external business activities.

We began by rolling out the service to Samsung affiliates and have been actively pursuing external opportunities. As a result, we've won several contracts for generative AI implementation projects from the banking sector.

Our generative AI technology has shown its superiority through advanced features like high-performance AI knowledge search, powerful development tools, and optimized learning. Winning these contracts has been a key milestone in solidifying our leadership in the market.

In the public sector, we were chosen as a private investment project contractor in the firs t half of the year. We're now gearing up for pilot projects with ten different institutions, setting ourselves up to achieve significant results in the public market as well.
