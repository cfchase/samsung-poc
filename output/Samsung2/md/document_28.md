In Q2, CSP sales grew by 49% year-on-year. The main drivers were the steady performance of HPC and the significant increase in demand for GPUs for generative

AI, as well as the diversification of new services added last year, such as cloud networks. In addition, increased SCP sales have driven growth of CSP business. We plan to continue expanding CSP focusing on SCP business. To this end, we will invest in services such as Oracle DRCC service, cloud DR, and AI specialized products, securing service competitiveness.

We are also opening the Daegu Center in October and starting AI cloud services for administrative public institutions, reinforcing our capabilities in the public cloud market.

The smart factory business is broadly divided into traditional MES business and digital twin business using new technologies.

In the traditional MES business, some new cloud MES companies are emerging in the global market, but the nature of MES, which requires high stability, means that onpremise MES business is still dominant. Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.

The digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects, but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data, identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the digital twin platform.

We plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory setup and layout changes, but

we do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across different domains. We will update our business plans based on the progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.

## **[Conclusion]**

Finally, I would like to make some announcements and conclude the conference call.

The IR team provides real-time streaming services and a replay function on the

Samsung SDS website for the earnings announcement conference call.

Starting with this earnings announcement, we are now able to provide scripts in Korean and English using our generative AI technology.

Especially since this is the first time we provide English scripts including Q&A for the conference call, it will greatly help foreign investors understand the earnings announcement content.

We will actively apply generative AI to various IR activities to enhance communication with investors and analysts.

This concludes the 2024 Q2 earnings announcement conference call of Samsung SDS. Thank you for attending today's conference call.
