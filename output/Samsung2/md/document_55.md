Therefore, by continuously pursuing operational automation, we can reduce operating costs, which is expected to contribute to the increase in operating profit in the long term, although there may not be significant changes in the short term.

The overseas SaaS business includes the cloud EMM business and the newly launched SRM SaaS business.

The cloud EMM business is continuously expanding, with additional service offerings developed recently, and is expected to continue growing in the second half and next year.

The SRM SaaS business started this year and is in its early stages. Enterprise SaaS solutions have an absolute sales lead time. Therefore, we expect visible results to appear in the second half of this year and be in full swing next year.

We are actively engaging in sales activities with many customers and overseas potential customers and have made significant progress with some, but we expect tangible results appearing from the second half of this year or the first half of next year, considering the sales lead time.

Our cash holdings continue to increase, but growth-oriented CAPEX, R&D, and M&A are priorities. We have been considering enhancing shareholder value even before the Corporate Value-up program was announced.

We are considering expanding and sustaining shareholder policies in line with the announced program, but we have no confirmed details to share at this time.

## **Q: Joonsop Kim from KB Securities**

First, the high growth of CSP is impressive. Can you provide guidelines on how to view the future of the CSP business? Also, regarding the core business of CSP, HPC services, can you provide updates on additional large-scale investments or customer discovery?

The second one is the smart factory. I know that there has been a trend that various new business companies have jumped into the recent smart factory market, but I am curious about the prospect of the market and what countermeasures Samsung SDS will take.
