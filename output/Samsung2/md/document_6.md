On slide 4, you will see that the global SaaS business, one of the pillars of MSP, experienced significant growth thanks to the acceleration of SaaS adoption in SCM, CRM, HCM, and other core business areas. As mentioned in the previous quarter, we are carrying out the next-generation SCM implementation project for Samsung Electronics, and additionally secured the first phase SCM data platform implementation project. In HCM, we secured integrated HR system implementation projects in manufacturing and service sectors and expect to expand non-captive business using Workday reseller partnership.

Our SaaS business also grew through the increase in subscription and license sales of solutions such as cloud EMM and Brity Automation.

The enterprise collaboration solution Brity Works continues to generate stable revenue. Following the launch of Brity Copilot for generative AI-based automation in April, we have been enhancing services of integrated search/summary linked with internal and external knowledge and MS office add-in features. The service enhancement is expected to drive sales growth in the second half.

Our work automation solution, Brity Automation secured the top market share in Korea with growing license sales through securing large financial customers beating global solutions. We plan to expand the generative AI business in the second half based on successful business cases in the bio industry.

We are working together with Emro for the SRM SaaS solution business to enter the global market. We named the SRM SaaS solution as Caidentia and participated in the Gartner Supply Chain Symposium held in North America, identifying leads and initiating full-scale sales activities in the North American market. We are promoting the business through follow-up meetings with the leads that are in need for the solution and will strive to win orders in overseas market in the second half.

Thank you for your attention.
