Net profit was KRW 190 billion, a 12.2% decrease from the previous quarter but an 11.8% increase year-over-year.

Next, let's review the performance by business division on page 2.

First, Q2 IT services revenue was KRW 1.59 trillion, a 2.1% increase from the previous quarter and a 5% increase year-over-year. The cloud business contributed significantly to this growth, with revenue of KRW 556 billion, a 4.8% increase from the previous quarter and a 25% increase year-over-year. The logistics business revenue was KRW 1.78 trillion, a 5.3% increase from the previous quarter, maintaining the same level as the previous year.

The operating profit for IT services in Q2 was KRW 198 billion, an approximate 17% increase from both the previous quarter and the same period last year. The operating profit margin was 12.5%, a 1.6 percentage point increase from the previous quarter and a 1.3 percentage point improvement year-over-year.

The logistics business recorded an operating profit of KRW 23 billion with an operating profit margin of 1.3%. The decline in logistics operating profit margin in Q2 is due to significant one-time gains in Q1 and reduced profitability from decreased air transport revenue in Q2.

This concludes the brief overview of Q2 performance.
