In the public business, we will continue promoting cloud transformation while expanding our business scope to new technology areas such as data analytics based on generative AI. Additionally, we plan to expand our public business by focusing on integrated platform projects for the Digital Platform Government of Korea.

We aim to secure visible achievements centered on the financial and public sectors in the rapidly growing generative AI market in the second half and expand to various industries.

Thank you for your attention.

## **[Cloud Service Business Division]**

Good afternoon, I am Hyungjoon Koo, Vice President of the Cloud Service Business Division. I will present the Q2 performance and second-half plans for the cloud business.

Please refer to slide 4.

Cloud revenue was KRW 556 billion, a 25% increase year-over-year.

CSP sales were KRW 209.5 billion, a 49% increase year-on-year. The sales have steadily increased thanks to a growing demand for HPC servers and the significant increase in demand for GPUs for generative AI services.

MSP sales were KRW 248.1 billion, an 11% increase year-on-year but a slight decrease from the previous quarter. With the continued orders for cloud transformation projects and generative AI projects, we expect a significant sales increase in the next quarter.

With the generative AI platform FabriX launched in April, we have achieved the results of receiving orders for generative AI business and data platform business in th e fin ancial sector.

By leveraging our generative AI technologies and experience in large-scale projects, SDS won large commercial bank projects, solidifying our position as a leading company in generative AI.

In the second half, we will accelerate cloud and generative AI businesses, focusing on the financial and public sectors.

In the financial sector, we will actively participate in AI platform implementation projects using use cases and order references, while expanding cloud transformation projects for banks and insurance companies.
