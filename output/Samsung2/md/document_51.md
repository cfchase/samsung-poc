Regarding the plan for securing FabriX products in the second half, we plan to release three additional products to stay ahead in the fast-evolving generative AI landscape. Our plan is to expand built-in plug-in functions such as Code Interpreter and develop use case-specific RAG models.

We'll leverage the contracts and use cases gained from various PoCs in finance and the public sector to further drive our focus on cloud and generative AI projects.

We will strive to achieve good results as we are one step ahead of our competitors in terms of technology and orders.

## **Q: Junho Lee from Hana Securities**

Firstly, you mentioned plans to focus on cloud transformation projects in the financial sector during the second half of the year. Can you provide more details on the current

market situation of the financial sector and SDS's approach to these business opportunities? Also, is there a possibility of lower profit margins if orders occur in th e fin ancial and public sectors? Secondly, regarding the recent CrowdStrike incident, do you expect a slight slowdown in CSP business, or do you expect to benefit from the expansion of multi-cloud?

## **A1: Jeongheon Lee, EVP and Strategic Marketing Office Leader**

In the financial sector, the easing of regulations is accelerating the transformation to cloud-based systems. After major banks, insurance companies and other second-ti er fin ancial institutions are now beginning to implement next-generation cloud systems. Also, interest in applying new technologies such as generative AI is also increasing.

The financial IT business is largely composed of core system, information system, and channel system. The core system is the unique business system of financial institutions, such as loans and deposits. The information system is the system for storing and analyzing data related to customers and operations, and the channel system is the system used directly by customers, such as internet banking and mobile banking. In Q2, our financial business secured core system implementation projects for large banks such as KDB Bank and information system projects for the insurance industry such as ABL Life Insurance. We also secured generative AI platform implementation projects in two large commercial banks.
