Good afternoon, I am Jeongheon Lee, Executive Vice President of the Strategic Marketing Office. I will explain the Q2 performance and the outlook for the second half of the year for the IT services division.

In Q2, we secured major projects in the financial sector and expanded our ERP business to various industries. Additionally, we achieved significant results in the generative AI business, strengthening our market recognition and establishing a foundation for continuous growth.

In the financial business, we continuously explored and actively participated in noncaptive business opportunities, securing core banking systems projects for large banks and data/information systems projects for the insurance companies.

For the ERP business, we expanded our operations to various industries such as electronics, heavy industry, and consumer goods, based on preliminary consulting projects carried out in Q1 and industry-specific strategies.

In the enterprise generative AI business, we launched the FabriX, Brity Copilot in April, securing various business cases and actively promoting our business.

We secured consecutive orders for AI platform projects from banks and new technology-based reference projects from public institutions, solidifying our position as a leading player in the generative AI market. Furthermore, we have completed the application of FabriX to 11 Samsung affiliates in the first half and are sequentially proceeding with contracts for the remaining affiliates.

Next, I will discuss the IT business outlook for the second half.

The domestic economy is expected to experience delayed recovery in the second half. However, industries showing performance improvement thanks to increased exports such as semiconductors and automobiles are anticipated to see an increase in IT investments. The financial and public sectors are expected to improve business conditions, with continuously promoting cloud transformation and generative AI businesses.

In the financial business, we will intensively pursue next-generation information systems for insurance and expand core business projects for large insurance companies, while securing additional reference projects from banks.
