The cloud business contributed significantly to this growth, with revenue of KRW 556 billion, a 4.8% increase from the previous quarter and a 25% increase year-over-year. The logistics business revenue was KRW 1.78 trillion, a 5.3% increase from the previous quarter, maintaining the same level as the previous year.\n\nThe operating profit for IT services in Q2 was KRW 198 billion, an approximate 17% increase from both the previous quarter and the same period last year. The operating profit margin was 12.5%, a 1.6 percentage point increase from the previous quarter and a 1.3 percentage point improvement year-over-year.\n\nThe logistics business recorded an operating profit of KRW 23 billion with an operating profit margin of 1.3%. The decline in logistics operating profit margin in Q2 is due to significant one-time gains in Q1 and reduced profitability from decreased air transport revenue in Q2.\n\nThis concludes the brief overview of Q2 performance.\n\nAdditionally, regarding Samsung SDS's ESG, we published and distributed the 2023 Samsung SDS Sustainability Report on our website on June 30, explaining our ESG performance.

By logistics segment, ocean transport revenue increased in Q2 compared to last quarter due to the early peak season caused by major country tariff policies and the Red Sea issue as well as rising freight rate. However, air transport revenue decreased in Q2 due to the completion of new product transportation for major customers in Q1. Inland transport and warehouse logistics revenue increased compared to the previous quarter due to increased cargo volume in North America.\n\nCello Square revenue in Q2 was KRW 285 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter. Overseas revenue is expanding in regions such as China, North America, and Europe as well. The number of registered customers increased by 2,000 from the previous quarter to 14,800, and the cumulative number of shipment customers also increased by 15%.\n\nWe continuously improve competitiveness of customer services and operational productivity using generative AI. To minimize the impact of global supply chain risks on customers' global operations, we collect 60,000 news items daily and analyze their relevance to logistics so that we can detect logistics-related risks at an early stage and establish response plans. We analyze importance and estimate cargo volume using generative AI to minimize the impact on customers' businesses.\n\nNext, I will discuss the market outlook and business strategy for the second half.\n\nOcean freight rates have been surging due to increased external uncertainties such as tight capacity on major routes, ongoing conflicts, tariff policy changes, and strikes. These conditions are anticipated to persist in the second half. Congestion at major Asian ports like Shanghai and Singapore also contributes to increasing operational risks.\n\nAir transport rates are expected to remain strong in the second half due to increased ecommerce cargo from China and continued demand shifts from ocean caused by the Red Sea situation. Despite the high external uncertainty, SDS will proactively secure stable capacity and competitive rate through long-term partnerships with shipping and airline companies to minimize customers' logistics burden."}

Since April, we've been actively involved in various internal and external business activities.\n\nWe began by rolling out the service to Samsung affiliates and have been actively pursuing external opportunities. As a result, we've won several contracts for generative AI implementation projects from the banking sector.\n\nOur generative AI technology has shown its superiority through advanced features like high-performance AI knowledge search, powerful development tools, and optimized learning. Winning these contracts has been a key milestone in solidifying our leadership in the market.\n\nIn the public sector, we were chosen as a private investment project contractor in the firs t half of the year. We're now gearing up for pilot projects with ten different institutions, setting ourselves up to achieve significant results in the public market as well."}

Can you provide more details on the current\n\nmarket situation of the financial sector and SDS's approach to these business opportunities? Also, is there a possibility of lower profit margins if orders occur in th e fin ancial and public sectors? Secondly, regarding the recent CrowdStrike incident, do you expect a slight slowdown in CSP business, or do you expect to benefit from the expansion of multi-cloud?\n\n## **A1: Jeongheon Lee, EVP and Strategic Marketing Office Leader**\n\nIn the financial sector, the easing of regulations is accelerating the transformation to cloud-based systems. After major banks, insurance companies and other second-ti er fin ancial institutions are now beginning to implement next-generation cloud systems. Also, interest in applying new technologies such as generative AI is also increasing.\n\nThe financial IT business is largely composed of core system, information system, and channel system. The core system is the unique business system of financial institutions, such as loans and deposits. The information system is the system for storing and analyzing data related to customers and operations, and the channel system is the system used directly by customers, such as internet banking and mobile banking. In Q2, our financial business secured core system implementation projects for large banks such as KDB Bank and information system projects for the insurance industry such as ABL Life Insurance. We also secured generative AI platform implementation projects in two large commercial banks."}

The main drivers were the steady performance of HPC and the significant increase in demand for GPUs for generative\n\nAI, as well as the diversification of new services added last year, such as cloud networks. In addition, increased SCP sales have driven growth of CSP business. We plan to continue expanding CSP focusing on SCP business.

Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.\n\nThe digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects, but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data, identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the digital twin platform.\n\nWe plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory setup and layout changes, but\n\nwe do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across different domains. We will update our business plans based on the progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.\n\n## **[Conclusion]**\n\nFinally, I would like to make some announcements and conclude the conference call.\n\nThe IR team provides real-time streaming services and a replay function on the\n\nSamsung SDS website for the earnings announcement conference call.\n\nStarting with this earnings announcement, we are now able to provide scripts in Korean and English using our generative AI technology.\n\nEspecially since this is the first time we provide English scripts including Q&A for the conference call, it will greatly help foreign investors understand the earnings announcement content.\n\nWe will actively apply generative AI to various IR activities to enhance communication with investors and analysts.\n\nThis concludes the 2024 Q2 earnings announcement conference call of Samsung SDS.

The cloud business contributed significantly to this growth, with revenue of KRW 556 billion, a 4.8% increase from the previous quarter and a 25% increase year-over-year. The logistics business revenue was KRW 1.78 trillion, a 5.3% increase from the previous quarter, maintaining the same level as the previous year.\n\nThe operating profit for IT services in Q2 was KRW 198 billion, an approximate 17% increase from both the previous quarter and the same period last year. The operating profit margin was 12.5%, a 1.6 percentage point increase from the previous quarter and a 1.3 percentage point improvement year-over-year.\n\nThe logistics business recorded an operating profit of KRW 23 billion with an operating profit margin of 1.3%. The decline in logistics operating profit margin in Q2 is due to significant one-time gains in Q1 and reduced profitability from decreased air transport revenue in Q2.\n\nThis concludes the brief overview of Q2 performance.\n\nAdditionally, regarding Samsung SDS's ESG, we published and distributed the 2023 Samsung SDS Sustainability Report on our website on June 30, explaining our ESG performance. Please refer to this newly published report to understand our ESG management performance and strategies.\n\nNow, let me open the floor for division leaders to explain the performance of Q2 and outline any upcoming plans.\n\n## **[Strategic Marketing Office]**"}

By logistics segment, ocean transport revenue increased in Q2 compared to last quarter due to the early peak season caused by major country tariff policies and the Red Sea issue as well as rising freight rate. However, air transport revenue decreased in Q2 due to the completion of new product transportation for major customers in Q1. Inland transport and warehouse logistics revenue increased compared to the previous quarter due to increased cargo volume in North America.\n\nCello Square revenue in Q2 was KRW 285 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter. Overseas revenue is expanding in regions such as China, North America, and Europe as well. The number of registered customers increased by 2,000 from the previous quarter to 14,800, and the cumulative number of shipment customers also increased by 15%.\n\nWe continuously improve competitiveness of customer services and operational productivity using generative AI. To minimize the impact of global supply chain risks on customers' global operations, we collect 60,000 news items daily and analyze their relevance to logistics so that we can detect logistics-related risks at an early stage and establish response plans. We analyze importance and estimate cargo volume using generative AI to minimize the impact on customers' businesses.\n\nNext, I will discuss the market outlook and business strategy for the second half.\n\nOcean freight rates have been surging due to increased external uncertainties such as tight capacity on major routes, ongoing conflicts, tariff policy changes, and strikes. These conditions are anticipated to persist in the second half. Congestion at major Asian ports like Shanghai and Singapore also contributes to increasing operational risks.\n\nAir transport rates are expected to remain strong in the second half due to increased ecommerce cargo from China and continued demand shifts from ocean caused by the Red Sea situation. Despite the high external uncertainty, SDS will proactively secure stable capacity and competitive rate through long-term partnerships with shipping and airline companies to minimize customers' logistics burden."}

Can you provide more details on the current\n\nmarket situation of the financial sector and SDS's approach to these business opportunities? Also, is there a possibility of lower profit margins if orders occur in th e fin ancial and public sectors? Secondly, regarding the recent CrowdStrike incident, do you expect a slight slowdown in CSP business, or do you expect to benefit from the expansion of multi-cloud?\n\n## **A1: Jeongheon Lee, EVP and Strategic Marketing Office Leader**\n\nIn the financial sector, the easing of regulations is accelerating the transformation to cloud-based systems. After major banks, insurance companies and other second-ti er fin ancial institutions are now beginning to implement next-generation cloud systems. Also, interest in applying new technologies such as generative AI is also increasing.\n\nThe financial IT business is largely composed of core system, information system, and channel system. The core system is the unique business system of financial institutions, such as loans and deposits. The information system is the system for storing and analyzing data related to customers and operations, and the channel system is the system used directly by customers, such as internet banking and mobile banking. In Q2, our financial business secured core system implementation projects for large banks such as KDB Bank and information system projects for the insurance industry such as ABL Life Insurance. We also secured generative AI platform implementation projects in two large commercial banks."}

We're set to lead the market by providing unique value-added services that distinguish SDS, driven by our expertise in cloud and generative AI technologies.\n\n## **A2: Scott HJ Koo, EVP and Cloud Service Business Division Leader**\n\nThe CrowdStrike incident is related to security solutions rather than CSP issues. As security solutions are necessary for all companies, it can be an opportunity for CSPs that can manage them well. MSP providers with well-organized procedures and problem-solving capabilities will be highly sought after.\n\n## **Q: Soojin Kim from Mirae Asset Securities**\n\nRegarding Brity Copilot, a generative AI product, can you explain the current business status and future prospects?\n\n## **A: Haegoo Song, EVP and Solution Business Division Leader**\n\nTo support the implementation of hyper-automation in corporate work, we launched Brity Copilot, a solution integrating generative AI into common work solutions such as mail, messenger, meetings, and document management in Brity Works in April. We are promoting the expansion of the service to Samsung affiliates and external markets after applying it internally in SDS. As of July, about 90,000 employees from Samsung affiliates such as Electronics and C&T are using this service."}

We are also conducting PoCs with 14 customers in industries such as petrochemicals, automotive, and food and beverage, and expect to secure more customers in the second half. Additionally, we plan to expand the business targeting large corporations, finance, and public sectors with high security needs through private cloud offerings.\n\nRegarding the product improvement plans for the second half, we are preparing for enabling the use of Brity Copilot in office programs such as Microsoft Word, PowerPoint, and Outlook.\n\nMeeting Copilot currently supports real-time captions in Korean and English and plans to support 10 languages including Vietnamese and Japanese, and provide offline meeting mode that can distinguish speakers in the same place. This service enhancement will help us secure more use cases, so we expect to drive sales growth in the second half.\n\nWe are also developing plug-in functions to integrate corporate work systems with Copilot. We will provide optimized Copilot services for enterprises by linking with major global solutions widely used in companies, such as Workday and Confluence.

We will also strengthen inland transport and warehouse operation services in major destinations, continuously expanding the import logistics business in large consumer markets.\n\n## **A2: Won Seo, IR Team Leader**\n\nThe revenue from generative AI is expected to come from FabriX in the form of PaaS, MSP revenue from implementation, SaaS revenue from Brity Copilot, and GPU server sales. In the first half, the revenue was not significant, but it is expected to be generated mainly in the second half. So we expect the annual revenue to reach the mid-KRW 100 billion range.\n\n## **Q: Seokjin Jang from Kyobo AXA Asset Management**\n\nFirst, will the increase in Cello Square sales structurally improve the logistics operating profit margin in the future?

The main drivers were the steady performance of HPC and the significant increase in demand for GPUs for generative\n\nAI, as well as the diversification of new services added last year, such as cloud networks. In addition, increased SCP sales have driven growth of CSP business. We plan to continue expanding CSP focusing on SCP business. To this end, we will invest in services such as Oracle DRCC service, cloud DR, and AI specialized products, securing service competitiveness.\n\nWe are also opening the Daegu Center in October and starting AI cloud services for administrative public institutions, reinforcing our capabilities in the public cloud market.\n\n## **A2: Haegoo Song, Vice President of Solution Business Division**\n\nThe smart factory business is broadly divided into traditional MES business and digital twin business using new technologies.\n\nIn the traditional MES business, some new cloud MES companies are emerging in the global market, but the nature of MES, which requires high stability, means that onpremise MES business is still dominant. Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.\n\nThe digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects, but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data, identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the digital twin platform.\n\nWe plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory setup and layout changes, but\n\nwe do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across different domains. We will update our business plans based on the progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.\n\n## **[Conclusion]**\n\nFinally, I would like to make some announcements and conclude the conference call.\n\nThe IR team provides real-time streaming services and a replay function on the\n\nSamsung SDS website for the earnings announcement conference call.\n\nStarting with this earnings announcement, we are now able to provide scripts in Korean and English using our generative AI technology.\n\nEspecially since this is the first time we provide English scripts including Q&A for the conference call, it will greatly help foreign investors understand the earnings announcement content.\n\nWe will actively apply generative AI to various IR activities to enhance communication with investors and analysts.\n\nThis concludes the 2024 Q2 earnings announcement conference call of Samsung SDS.

Thank you.\n\n## **[Q&A Session]**\n\n## **Q: Hoyoon Jung from Korea Investment & Securities**\n\nCan you briefly explain the business performance since the launch of FabriX and the business plans for the second half of the year?\n\n## **A: Scott HJ Koo, EVP and Cloud Service Business Division Leader**\n\nWe launched FabriX, our enterprise generative AI platform, to support the full spectrum of GenAI service development and use. Since April, we've been actively involved in various internal and external business activities.\n\nWe began by rolling out the service to Samsung affiliates and have been actively pursuing external opportunities. As a result, we've won several contracts for generative AI implementation projects from the banking sector.\n\nOur generative AI technology has shown its superiority through advanced features like high-performance AI knowledge search, powerful development tools, and optimized learning. Winning these contracts has been a key milestone in solidifying our leadership in the market.\n\nIn the public sector, we were chosen as a private investment project contractor in the firs t half of the year. We're now gearing up for pilot projects with ten different institutions, setting ourselves up to achieve significant results in the public market as well."}

Can you provide more details on the current\n\nmarket situation of the financial sector and SDS's approach to these business opportunities? Also, is there a possibility of lower profit margins if orders occur in th e fin ancial and public sectors? Secondly, regarding the recent CrowdStrike incident, do you expect a slight slowdown in CSP business, or do you expect to benefit from the expansion of multi-cloud?\n\n## **A1: Jeongheon Lee, EVP and Strategic Marketing Office Leader**\n\nIn the financial sector, the easing of regulations is accelerating the transformation to cloud-based systems. After major banks, insurance companies and other second-ti er fin ancial institutions are now beginning to implement next-generation cloud systems. Also, interest in applying new technologies such as generative AI is also increasing.\n\nThe financial IT business is largely composed of core system, information system, and channel system. The core system is the unique business system of financial institutions, such as loans and deposits. The information system is the system for storing and analyzing data related to customers and operations, and the channel system is the system used directly by customers, such as internet banking and mobile banking. In Q2, our financial business secured core system implementation projects for large banks such as KDB Bank and information system projects for the insurance industry such as ABL Life Insurance. We also secured generative AI platform implementation projects in two large commercial banks."}

The main drivers were the steady performance of HPC and the significant increase in demand for GPUs for generative\n\nAI, as well as the diversification of new services added last year, such as cloud networks. In addition, increased SCP sales have driven growth of CSP business. We plan to continue expanding CSP focusing on SCP business. To this end, we will invest in services such as Oracle DRCC service, cloud DR, and AI specialized products, securing service competitiveness.\n\nWe are also opening the Daegu Center in October and starting AI cloud services for administrative public institutions, reinforcing our capabilities in the public cloud market.\n\n## **A2: Haegoo Song, Vice President of Solution Business Division**\n\nThe smart factory business is broadly divided into traditional MES business and digital twin business using new technologies.\n\nIn the traditional MES business, some new cloud MES companies are emerging in the global market, but the nature of MES, which requires high stability, means that onpremise MES business is still dominant. Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.\n\nThe digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects, but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data, identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the digital twin platform.\n\nWe plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory setup and layout changes, but\n\nwe do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across different domains. We will update our business plans based on the progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.\n\n## **[Conclusion]**\n\nFinally, I would like to make some announcements and conclude the conference call.\n\nThe IR team provides real-time streaming services and a replay function on the\n\nSamsung SDS website for the earnings announcement conference call.\n\nStarting with this earnings announcement, we are now able to provide scripts in Korean and English using our generative AI technology.\n\nEspecially since this is the first time we provide English scripts including Q&A for the conference call, it will greatly help foreign investors understand the earnings announcement content.\n\nWe will actively apply generative AI to various IR activities to enhance communication with investors and analysts.\n\nThis concludes the 2024 Q2 earnings announcement conference call of Samsung SDS. Thank you for attending today's conference call."}

The cloud business contributed significantly to this growth, with revenue of KRW 556 billion, a 4.8% increase from the previous quarter and a 25% increase year-over-year. The logistics business revenue was KRW 1.78 trillion, a 5.3% increase from the previous quarter, maintaining the same level as the previous year.\n\nThe operating profit for IT services in Q2 was KRW 198 billion, an approximate 17% increase from both the previous quarter and the same period last year. The operating profit margin was 12.5%, a 1.6 percentage point increase from the previous quarter and a 1.3 percentage point improvement year-over-year.\n\nThe logistics business recorded an operating profit of KRW 23 billion with an operating profit margin of 1.3%. The decline in logistics operating profit margin in Q2 is due to significant one-time gains in Q1 and reduced profitability from decreased air transport revenue in Q2.\n\nThis concludes the brief overview of Q2 performance.\n\nAdditionally, regarding Samsung SDS's ESG, we published and distributed the 2023 Samsung SDS Sustainability Report on our website on June 30, explaining our ESG performance. Please refer to this newly published report to understand our ESG management performance and strategies.\n\nNow, let me open the floor for division leaders to explain the performance of Q2 and outline any upcoming plans.\n\n## **[Strategic Marketing Office]**"}

By logistics segment, ocean transport revenue increased in Q2 compared to last quarter due to the early peak season caused by major country tariff policies and the Red Sea issue as well as rising freight rate. However, air transport revenue decreased in Q2 due to the completion of new product transportation for major customers in Q1. Inland transport and warehouse logistics revenue increased compared to the previous quarter due to increased cargo volume in North America.\n\nCello Square revenue in Q2 was KRW 285 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter. Overseas revenue is expanding in regions such as China, North America, and Europe as well. The number of registered customers increased by 2,000 from the previous quarter to 14,800, and the cumulative number of shipment customers also increased by 15%.\n\nWe continuously improve competitiveness of customer services and operational productivity using generative AI. To minimize the impact of global supply chain risks on customers' global operations, we collect 60,000 news items daily and analyze their relevance to logistics so that we can detect logistics-related risks at an early stage and establish response plans. We analyze importance and estimate cargo volume using generative AI to minimize the impact on customers' businesses.\n\nNext, I will discuss the market outlook and business strategy for the second half.\n\nOcean freight rates have been surging due to increased external uncertainties such as tight capacity on major routes, ongoing conflicts, tariff policy changes, and strikes. These conditions are anticipated to persist in the second half. Congestion at major Asian ports like Shanghai and Singapore also contributes to increasing operational risks.\n\nAir transport rates are expected to remain strong in the second half due to increased ecommerce cargo from China and continued demand shifts from ocean caused by the Red Sea situation. Despite the high external uncertainty, SDS will proactively secure stable capacity and competitive rate through long-term partnerships with shipping and airline companies to minimize customers' logistics burden."}

We also secured generative AI\nplatform implementation projects in two large commercial banks.\n\nIn the second half, we plan to focus on core system implementation\nprojects in the insurance industry and information system projects using\ngenerative AI technology for data analysis and real-time marketing in the\nsecond-tier financial sector.\n\nWe do not expect the profit margin to be significantly affected by the\nbusiness we are promoting. We're set to lead the market by providing\nunique value-added services that distinguish SDS, driven by our expertise\nin cloud and generative AI technologies.\n\n## A2: Scott HJ Koo, EVP and Cloud Service Business Division Leader\n\nThe CrowdStrike incident is related to security solutions rather than CSP\nissues. As security solutions are necessary for all companies, it can be\nan opportunity for CSPs that can manage them well.

The main drivers were the steady performance of HPC and the significant increase in demand for GPUs for generative\n\nAI, as well as the diversification of new services added last year, such as cloud networks. In addition, increased SCP sales have driven growth of CSP business. We plan to continue expanding CSP focusing on SCP business. To this end, we will invest in services such as Oracle DRCC service, cloud DR, and AI specialized products, securing service competitiveness.\n\nWe are also opening the Daegu Center in October and starting AI cloud services for administrative public institutions, reinforcing our capabilities in the public cloud market.\n\n## **A2: Haegoo Song, Vice President of Solution Business Division**\n\nThe smart factory business is broadly divided into traditional MES business and digital twin business using new technologies.\n\nIn the traditional MES business, some new cloud MES companies are emerging in the global market, but the nature of MES, which requires high stability, means that onpremise MES business is still dominant. Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.\n\nThe digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects, but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data, identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the digital twin platform.\n\nWe plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory setup and layout changes, but\n\nwe do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across different domains. We will update our business plans based on the progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.\n\n## **[Conclusion]**\n\nFinally, I would like to make some announcements and conclude the conference call.\n\nThe IR team provides real-time streaming services and a replay function on the\n\nSamsung SDS website for the earnings announcement conference call.\n\nStarting with this earnings announcement, we are now able to provide scripts in Korean and English using our generative AI technology.\n\nEspecially since this is the first time we provide English scripts including Q&A for the conference call, it will greatly help foreign investors understand the earnings announcement content.\n\nWe will actively apply generative AI to various IR activities to enhance communication with investors and analysts.\n\nThis concludes the 2024 Q2 earnings announcement conference call of Samsung SDS. Thank you for attending today's conference call."}

By logistics segment, ocean transport revenue increased in Q2 compared to last quarter due to the early peak season caused by major country tariff policies and the Red Sea issue as well as rising freight rate. However, air transport revenue decreased in Q2 due to the completion of new product transportation for major customers in Q1. Inland transport and warehouse logistics revenue increased compared to the previous quarter due to increased cargo volume in North America.\n\nCello Square revenue in Q2 was KRW 285 billion, a 12% increase from the previous quarter. Overseas revenue is expanding in regions such as China, North America, and Europe as well. The number of registered customers increased by 2,000 from the previous quarter to 14,800, and the cumulative number of shipment customers also increased by 15%.\n\nWe continuously improve competitiveness of customer services and operational productivity using generative AI. To minimize the impact of global supply chain risks on customers' global operations, we collect 60,000 news items daily and analyze their relevance to logistics so that we can detect logistics-related risks at an early stage and establish response plans. We analyze importance and estimate cargo volume using generative AI to minimize the impact on customers' businesses.\n\nNext, I will discuss the market outlook and business strategy for the second half.\n\nOcean freight rates have been surging due to increased external uncertainties such as tight capacity on major routes, ongoing conflicts, tariff policy changes, and strikes. These conditions are anticipated to persist in the second half. Congestion at major Asian ports like Shanghai and Singapore also contributes to increasing operational risks.\n\nAir transport rates are expected to remain strong in the second half due to increased ecommerce cargo from China and continued demand shifts from ocean caused by the Red Sea situation. Despite the high external uncertainty, SDS will proactively secure stable capacity and competitive rate through long-term partnerships with shipping and airline companies to minimize customers' logistics burden."}

Since April, we've been actively involved in various internal and external business activities.\n\nWe began by rolling out the service to Samsung affiliates and have been actively pursuing external opportunities. As a result, we've won several contracts for generative AI implementation projects from the banking sector.\n\nOur generative AI technology has shown its superiority through advanced features like high-performance AI knowledge search, powerful development tools, and optimized learning. Winning these contracts has been a key milestone in solidifying our leadership in the market.\n\nIn the public sector, we were chosen as a private investment project contractor in the firs t half of the year. We're now gearing up for pilot projects with ten different institutions, setting ourselves up to achieve significant results in the public market as well."}

After major banks, insurance companies and other second-ti er fin ancial institutions are now beginning to implement next-generation cloud systems. Also, interest in applying new technologies such as generative AI is also increasing.\n\nThe financial IT business is largely composed of core system, information system, and channel system. The core system is the unique business system of financial institutions, such as loans and deposits. The information system is the system for storing and analyzing data related to customers and operations, and the channel system is the system used directly by customers, such as internet banking and mobile banking. In Q2, our financial business secured core system implementation projects for large banks such as KDB Bank and information system projects for the insurance industry such as ABL Life Insurance. We also secured generative AI platform implementation projects in two large commercial banks."}

Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.\n\nThe digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects, but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data, identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the digital twin platform.\n\nWe plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory setup and layout changes, but\n\nwe do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across different domains. We will update our business plans based on the progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.\n\n## **[Conclusion]**\n\nFinally, I would like to make some announcements and conclude the conference call.\n\nThe IR team provides real-time streaming services and a replay function on the\n\nSamsung SDS website for the earnings announcement conference call.\n\nStarting with this earnings announcement, we are now able to provide scripts in Korean and English using our generative AI technology.\n\nEspecially since this is the first time we provide English scripts including Q&A for the conference call, it will greatly help foreign investors understand the earnings announcement content.\n\nWe will actively apply generative AI to various IR activities to enhance communication with investors and analysts.\n\nThis concludes the 2024 Q2 earnings announcement conference call of Samsung SDS. Thank you for attending today's conference call."}
