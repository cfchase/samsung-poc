## Message from the ESG Committee Chairperson

The ESG Committee will do its utmost to support Samsung SDS in faithfully practicing sustainability management based on the company's ESG strategy and core values.

Dear esteemed customers, shareholders, business partners, and all other stakeholders, I am Insill Yi, the Chairperson of Samsung SDS' ESG Committee.

I would like to begin our 2024 Sustainability Report by expressing my deepest gratitude to you for your heartfelt support and encouragement towards Samsung SDS.

Last year, the ESG Committee convened six meetings where we engaged in active discussions on developing the corporate ESG strategy and its specific implementation plan. As a result, we devised Samsung SDS' own sustainability management strategy system along with a roadmap for 11 key strategic initiatives across each ESG area.

The ESG Committee will do our utmost again this year to ensure Samsung SDS carries out stable ESG management based on our ESG strategy and core values.

## We will strengthen environmental management to contribute to a sustainable future.

Samsung SDS obtained ISO 50001 certification for energy management systems at all global business sites in 2023. In terms of our business, we will continue to make efforts in curbing carbon emissions by developing energy-efficient data center technology and expanding low-carbon logistics services.

## We will create a corporate culture that practices diversity, equity, and inclusion.

Samsung SDS operates a wide range of maternity protection programs to support pregnancies and childcare for female employees in striking a balance between work and family life. Moreover, we aim to actively implement the global DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) initiative starting this year to create a working environment that can embrace employees from diverse backgrounds.

## We will reinforce our sustainability management governance system.

Samsung SDS adopted the Senior Independent Director System in 2023 to strengthen independence and transparency of the Board of Directors. We will strive to further reinforce our governance system for sustainability management by composing the Related Party Transaction Committee and the Independent Director Recommendation Committee under the BOD entirely with independent directors this year and reviewing independent director candidates once a year.

Thank you again for your trust and confidence in Samsung SDS.

We will look forward to your continuous attention and unwavering support.

Company Overview

## Message from the CEO

Samsung SDS is dedicated to the sustainable growth of various stakeholders by embedding ESG values in the company's business and management activities.

## Greetings! I am Sungwoo Hwang, President and CEO of Samsung SDS.

It is a great pleasure to extend my warmest appreciation for your continuous affection and encouragement toward Samsung SDS as we present you with the 5th Samsung SDS Sustainability Report. Samsung SDS has made endeavors to transform its fundamental business model by focusing on the cloud and digital logistics businesses during the past three years. As a result, our cloud business saw revenues grow 62% in 2023 compared to the previous year with its revenue share in IT Services also increasing from 19% in 2022 to 31% in 2023. Our digital logistics business also expanded its service offerings steadily through Cello Square, increasing coverage to 13 countries and recording 129% year-on-year growth. Moreover, 2023 was the first year for all Samsung SDS services and solutions to be armored with generative AI.

Amid such changes, Samsung SDS is practicing a strategy to embed ESG values in the business under the vision 'IT's the Key to Sustainable Growth' to ensure all of the company's business activities contribute to the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders.

Taking into account that climate change is an urgent issue threatening the sustainability of our society, we are upgrading management of carbon emissions generated from our products and services. We built a real-time monitoring system to offer customers visibility on the carbon emissions related to our cloud and logistics services and are pursuing investments in high-efficiency equipment and adoption of new technologies such as immersion cooling to realize energy efficiency innovations at datacenters. We also plan to actively assist our customers in addressing ESG matters by leveraging IT technology to discover emissionreducing factors and securing supply chain ESG management functions.

Moreover, we are devoted to protecting the data and information of everyone related to the company including our customers. With generative AI triggering unprecedented change across society, there is growing need for ethical principles and guidelines to be applied our AI-based services. Therefore, we plan to establish a digital governance system that includes policies and technical solutions for offering responsible and fair IT services that embrace AI ethics and privacy protection.

The ESG paradigm in business is now going beyond the establishment of systems and plans to actual practice and performance creation. Transparency in ESG data is becoming increasingly important as regulations on mandatory ESG reporting are announced around the world including in Korea, the U.S., and Europe. Samsung SDS will concentrate on practical efforts to bring about substantial results and manage information systematically through an ESG data platform to provide information transparently to our stakeholders.

We look forward to your ongoing interest and support towards our journey towards a sustainable future.

Thank you.

10% energy efficiency improvement Adoption of high-efficiency equipment at Suwon DC

Amid the rapidly evolving business environment, Samsung SDS has built and executed a sustainability management strategy to secure sustainable growth drivers and continuously create substantial ESG results. In particular, as environmental issues such as climate change emerge as a pending threat to human survival, companies are faced with demands from stakeholders to present specific carbon reduction measures and transition to an eco-friendly business model.

Building on technology capabilities and the nature of its business, Samsung SDS has set 'providing eco-friendly values' as the strategic direction in the environmental area to address climate change and support clients in taking climate actions. In line with this direction, we have identified leveraging technology to curb carbon emissions, providing eco-friendly products and services, and implementing an ESG value delivery system as our environmental strategic initiatives.

## Leverage Technology to Curb Carbon Emissions

Based on technical knowhow, Samsung SDS is working hard to continuously lower carbon emissions. We are making efforts especially at our data centers to achieve low-power, high-efficiency operations by discovering and applying new technologies.

## Performance and Next Steps

As part of our carbon mitigation efforts, we replaced outdated equipment at the Suwon DC in 2023. We introduced high-efficiency UPS equipment which improved energy efficiency by more than 10% (85.4 → 95.9%) and cut energy usage by adopting inverters for engine power equipment.


<!-- image -->

## Minimize UPS

Installing UPS to power supply on one side can minimize power loss during blackouts an allow switching between power supplies

In addition, simulations were made on cooling methods to compare power usage effectiveness (PUE), and on the immersion cooling system to test its performance and build a database.

Immersion cooling proof of concept (PoC) was carried out for its introduction to data centers in 2024 which is expected to serve as the basis for us developing technology requirements and operation standards.

Beginning in 2026, we will conduct phased implementation of the system, using immersion cooling to significantly lower power consumption and mitigate carbon emissions by an annual 1,298 tCO$_{2}$eq/MW. Moreover, we expect to save KRW 400 million/MW in annual operating costs compared to conventional cooling.

Continuing to expand adoption of new technologies for low-power and high-efficiency data center operations, we will deliver ESG values to customers through an eco-cloud in the long-term.

## Immersive Liquid Cooling

A next-generation cooling solution to efficiently cool heated IT equipment where IT equipment are immersed in a special electrically non-conductive fluid to cool down without requiring an additional cooling device

## Provide Eco-friendly Products and Services

Samsung SDS supports the ESG management of customers with its IT technology and knowhow.

Clouds have lower energy consumption than on-premise infrastructure thanks to high density integration and energy efficient data centers using virtualization and resource-sharing technologies. In addition, analysis showed that companies can curb emissions by as much as 80% through cloud migration. Samsung SDS is contributing to the ESG management activities of customers by achieving significant carbon mitigations with the adoption of cloud services.

## Support ESG Activities of our Customers through Cloud Services

We launched a carbon dashboard in October 2023 that displays the status of carbon emissions to support ESG management at customers that use Samsung Cloud Platform (SCP).

·Features: Monthly emissions, emissions by product, monthly estimates, increase/decrease compared to previous month, monthly average, and monthly trends

## Offer Customized Carbon Emissions Data to Customers

We plan to offer carbon emissions data to customers based on cloud simulations to enable customers to manage emissions effectively on their own through an Open API aligned with the customer's ESG system.

·Simulate carbon emissions for selected product and offer data on reduction compared to on-premise

·Provide carbon emissions metrics via Open API and support use on the app and system through SCP

·Secure reliability by obtaining accreditation on emission measurement standards from a carbon emission certification agency

## Develop and Propose Carbon Reduction Factors

We will support our customer's ESG practices by validating and analyzing their on-premise carbon emissions and suggesting carbon reduction by transitioning to SCP.

·Offering MSP consulting services that demonstrate emission mitigation effects

·Providing carbon emission reduction contents such as appropriate cloud resources through the MSP portal and minimizing idle resources, etc.

## Implement a Carbon Dashboard for Logistics Services

The carbon dashboard for customers was created to help customers understand and make use of carbon emissions information. Cello manages transport data across all routes used to calculate emissions, securing reliability in calculations by utilizing EcoTransIT. A customized dashboard is provided to each of our customers, allowing emissions in the supply chain to be monitored immediately for control to support customers in managing emissions effectively throughout the logistics process.

The dashboard gives customers complete visibility into the emissions of all transport modes in the supply chain. This includes not only international routes, but also local routes and even emissions from logistics centers. Moreover, various types of analyses are supported such as carbon emissions and intensity, monthly and annual emissions trends, and information on top emission routes. This way, customers can manage emissions more efficiently across periods, routes, and transport modes associated with high carbon emissions.

## Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System

We set up the Cello Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System to manage emissions systematically across the 200 logistics centers operating in 35 countries worldwide. Previously, only emissions from transportation means such as air and sea transport could be monitored, but services have been extended to logistics centers to enable customers to view emissions across the entire logistics process. Based on data such as operating periods, area utilized, and electricity usage, emission factors of each country are incorporated to calculate real-time emissions on a monthly basis.

The ESG Platform oversees more than 1,518 ESG metrics, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy in data management through alignment with existing systems such as ERP, HR, and supply chain.

In 2023, the platform was extended to overseas subsidiaries and affiliates, laying the groundwork for systematic management of ESG data at our operations in the U.S., Europe, China, Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Latin America, and India and at 5 affiliates (Miracom, SECUI, S-Core, Multicampus, and Emro) by applying the same standards as headquarters. Samsung SDS will continue to take the initiative in the delivery of ESG values to customers through various solutions.

<!-- image -->

Responding to the needs of various stakeholders such as employees, supply chains, and consumers has material impact on corporate sustainability and risk management. Samsung SDS has continued to make various efforts to address the needs of various stakeholders and ultimately create social value. Accordingly, we set 'Social Value Creation' as the strategic direction of our social efforts and selected strengthening DEI to respect and embrace our diverse workforce and expanding and advancing safety and health management for our global employees and supply chains as our strategic social initiatives. In addition, we applied the supply chain ESG management system used at headquarters to our subsidiaries and overseas subsidiaries and identified building a digital responsibility management system was selected as a strategic initiative to manage the risks associated with the latest IT technologies. This way, we aim to respond to the needs of various stakeholders and create social value.

## Strengthen DEI

Samsung SDS has been devoted to creating an organizational culture that encourages diversity and inclusion. In 2019, we applied career level integration and horizontal titles for an organizational culture of mutual respect, and in 2022, we added DEI-related questions to the Samsung Culture Index (SCI) survey. We continue to conduct campaigns and activities to enhance employees' sense of belonging in the organization. In addition, as we welcome more employees with diverse backgrounds around the world along with the growth of our overseas business, we recognize the need for programs and activities to manage DEI issues more systematically.

## Performance and Next Steps

In 2023, Samsung SDS set up the DEI Secretariat, an organization dedicated to diversity and inclusion issues at the company, and also developed a DEI Roadmap for step-bystep implementation of DEI activities. In 2024, we will carry out various programs such as campaigns and training to raise DEI awareness while identifying the diversity of our workforce and reviewing regulations and responses related to diversity in each country. In 2025, we will prepare programs to support minority groups and specify our diversity goals based on the characteristics of the company. Starting in 2026, business activities linked to DEI will also be carried out and diversity goals will be met as we build an organizational culture that reaches the level of advanced global players.

## Expand and Reinforce Safety and Health Management

The safety and health of our employees and suppliers is an essential and fundamental element in achieving sustainable growth and creating social value. As employee and supplier safety is one of the core values the company delivers, Samsung SDS will manage safety and health systematically and expand such practices to its overseas subsidiaries and suppliers. In particular, we have strengthened our independence and expertise in safety and health management by establishing a dedicated safety and health organization in each business unit led by the EHS Center and its head, the Chief Safety Officer (CSO).

## Performance and Next Steps

Samsung SDS is actively carrying out various accident prevention and compliance activities through the field-oriented Smart Safety Management System (SSMS). In 2023, we increased developments of overseas features to apply SSMS to overseas subsidiaries to thoroughly implement accident prevention and post-incident follow-up measures. We continue to develop such functions and plan to expand SSMS overseas coverage by 2027.

In addition, as we recognize the importance of safety and health at subsidiaries, Samsung SDS plans to gradually expand the safety and health management system of headquarters to both domestic and overseas subsidiaries in 2024 followed with relevant consulting and support in 2025 to ensure the management systems are well maintained.

## Strengthen Supply Chain ESG

Managing ESG in the supply chain is the key to managing ESG risks. Therefore, Samsung SDS continues to expand activities to identify, improve, and prevent ESG related risks in the supply chain. In addition, we will apply our headquarters' supply chain ESG management system to not only our domestic subsidiaries, but also our overseas subsidiaries to fundamentally manage ESG risks along the supply chain. By doing so, we aim to ultimately contribute to society through the setup of a sustainable ESG supply chain ecosystem.

## Performance and Next Steps

We are working to evaluate our suppliers through a systematic process from planning, implementation, assessment, improvements, and monitoring, etc. and to ensure that ESG values are embedded across our entire business from the selection of suppliers to collaborating with them. In 2023, we established a team dedicated to supply chain ESG to strengthen independence and professionalism and to review the sustainability management systems of our suppliers.

The sustainability management system of suppliers assess all areas of ESG including labor rights, safety and the environment, business ethics, and management systems, and is scheduled to be extended to our subsidiaries along with supply chain evaluation systems in 2024.

Starting in 2025, we plan to gradually expand our supply chain ESG management system to overseas subsidiaries. By doing so, we plan to go beyond local supply chains in the regions where we do business simply complying with local laws and regulations and support building an environmentally and socially sustainable system.

## Build a Digital Responsibility Management System

The advance of cutting-edge IT technology makes life more convenient, but it also comes with strings attached. The spread of generative AI is especially grabbing attention as new issues such as deepfake technology and leak of personal information emerge. Samsung SDS is actively responding to such trends by defining AI ethics, personal information security, and open source policies as the three key pillars of the company's digital responsibility. We aim to fulfill our corporate social responsibility as an IT company by protecting our customers and stakeholders from various risks and issues caused by the introduction of new technology.

## Performance and Next Steps

Recently, the emergence of generative AI is triggering various social issues. In 2023, Samsung SDS launched a case study on AI governance systems and formed a company-wide digital responsibility task force. Following such efforts, we are currently building an AI governance system that reflects the 2024 international standards, best practices, and recommendations from global initiatives. Based on this system, we plan to apply an inspection system across the entire AI business lifecycle starting in 2025 and gradually expand it to our overseas subsidiaries in 2026. Through this, we will carry out rigorous review of the various risks that may be caused by the products and services provided by Samsung SDS.

Building a transparent and credible governance system is the force that drives ESG management. That's why Samsung SDS set 'Transparent Management' as the company's strategic direction in the area of governance. In order to strengthen the actual authority and roles of the Board of Directors, we are working towards enhancing the independence of the Board and establishing advanced global mechanisms to strengthen shareholder protection. In addition, we comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations which are being globally reinforced, as well as thoroughly mange economic/social losses and external risks that may arise from unethical business practices. We are also focusing various efforts to fulfill our role as a responsible IT company by building an information security risk management system to sharpen competitiveness and secure reliability in information security and create an internal security culture through active communication on such efforts.

## Enhance BOD Independence

Samsung SDS has put in place various mechanisms to enable the BOD to function independently of management and controlling shareholders. We strive to ensure the BOD maintains independence to carry out its role of supervising and keeping management decisions in check.

## Performance and Next Steps

In order to enhance BOD independence, we introduced the senior independent director system in October 2023. This system allows for appropriate balance and checks by appointing a senior independent director to represent independent directors when the CEO or an executive director serves as BOD Chair, and Hyun-Han Shin was selected as our first senior independent director. The senior independent director can arrange and convene meetings among the independent directors and supports communication between outside directors and the BOD Chair and members of management. Furthermore, composition of the Independent Director Recommendation Committee was changed to all outside directors in 2024 to advance the independent director screening process. Samsung SDS will faithfully operate the advanced Independent Director Recommendation Committee and continue to identify new measures for strengthening BOD indepdnence.

## Prepare Mechanisms for Increased Shareholder Protection

Samsung SDS has established various systems and mechanisms to respond to demands from society to enhance shareholder trust through shareholder returns and safeguarding shareholder rights and interests. We continue to actively communicate with our shareholders and investors and develop new policies to improve investor access to information and improve reliability.

## Performance and Next Steps

Samsung SDS declares its dividend policy based on which dividends are paid to enhance shareholder forecasts of dividends and improve stability.

The 3-year dividend policy was first announced in January 2020, and a new dividend policy that raises the dividend payout ratio was revealed in January 2023.

In 2024, we introduced a policy that expands the scope for proxy solicitation to support shareholder convenience and their active participation in exercising voting rights. Samsung SDS will continue to implement various mechanisms to protect the rights and interests of shareholders and build further trust.

## Strengthen Ethics and Compliance

Samsung SDS established the Code of Conduct Guidelines for the company to carry out its fundamental role as an enterprise and fulfill its social responsibility by ensuring all business activities observe laws and ethical standards as the guidelines serve as a criteria for judging the behaviors and decisions of Samsung SDS employees. In addition, we appoint compliance officers through Board resolutions and carry out autonomous compliance activities under a dedicated Compliance team. Through strict compliance and risk management, Samsung SDS will leap forward as a world-class company that contributes to society.

## Performance and Next Steps

Samsung SDS is advancing compliance management systems to strengthen compliance throughout its business. In 2023, we reviewed the qualifications that need to be met to be certified by an external accreditor and started full-fledged preparations to realize a more systematic compliance management system.

We are also doing our utmost to fight corruption in the organization by conducting anti-corruption education to management at our overseas subsidiaries in 2024. Samsung SDS will continue to implement various programs not only to reinforce business ethics and compliance, but also to take the lead in eradicating corruption by taking into account internal and external situations and acquiring external accreditation.

## Reinforce Information Security Risk Management

As a member of the IT sector, Samsung SDS is devoted to information security risk management. Under systematic governance, we have information security policies in place to define and protect all of the company's information assets and have appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to oversee and supervise all relevant activities. In addition, we have built a strong system that consists of a security incident prevention and response process to raise security awareness, internalize security practices, and minimize relevant risks.

## Performance and Next Steps

We are thoroughly managing information security risks through systematic governance and processes. We are also working hard to prevent information leaks by implementing various policies and activities such as operating a personal information management system, security checks, and security monitoring.

In addition, we made improvements to the 'Privacy Protection' section on our website and promoted it to external stakeholders to enhance their trust in our risk management regarding personal information protection.

In 2024, an 'Information Security' page was added to our website to reinforce communication and data disclosures through which we will continue to provide information accurately and promptly.

We will continue to update our information security contents through various channels and promote our information security risk management efforts to further strengthen trust from our key stakeholders.

## Climate Action

## GHG Emissions Management

Samsung SDS manages greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for each business site by classifying them into three scopes. As IT and logistics services are the key business areas of Samsung SDS, power consumption for operating domestic and global data centers account for the largest amount of our emissions while Scope 3 emissions from our global logistics services are also relatively high. GHG emissions at Samsung SDS are projected to continue to increase as our business grows which can trigger a severe climate risk. Acknowledging the importance of the environment, Samsung SDS implements and operates data centers equipped with the latest energy mitigation technologies to reduce this climate risk. Moreover, we plan to make a 100% transition to renewable energy by expanding solar power generation facilities and making REC purchases. In particular, we are disclosing not only emissions for domestic upstream transportation, but also our Scope 3 emissions that include global transportation to taken a preemptive response across the entire value chain as supply chain management including Scope 3 emissions becomes more important than before.

## Scope 1, 2 GHG Emissions

## GHG Emissions Reduction at Data Centers

Samsung SDS strives to reduce carbon emissions and operate sustainable business by carrying out various activities to curb GHG emissions. The Chuncheon Data Center extended the period of adopting free cooling by adjusting its temperature for free cooling from 2022 and switched the base criteria from temperatures to humidity in 2023 which reduced GHG emissions by around 432 tons. The Dongtan Data Center which opened in 2023 maintains server room temperatures relatively higher than typical data centers, reducing energy consumption by only relying on cooling towers for 70% of the time throughout the year. We will continue to seek ways such as leveraging solar power facilities to operate more energy-efficient data centers.

## GHG Emissions Reduction at Data Centers

## Energy Conservation by Replacing Outdated Facilities at Suwon DC

## UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)

IT equipment at data centers use uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) for stable power supply as they can be easily affected by fluctuations in voltage and frequencies, instantaneous interruptions, and voltage surges. The system requires conversions between AC and DC to switch between charging and discharging as UPS receives power supply from batteries in the event of power outages or voltage drops. The Suwon Data Center replaced its outdated UPS system with a modular high-efficiency UPS and old lead acid batteries with high-durability lithium-ion batteries to minimize the massive amount of electrical energy being lost in the form of heat energy during the conversion. Introduction of the high-efficiency UPS was found to have improved overall performance by around 10%, reducing approximately 565 tons of GHG emissions.

## Transformers

While extra high-voltage power is supplied to data centers to support their massive use of energy, transformers are needed to step down the voltages and make necessary adjustments to be used by IT equipment and other facilities. The Suwon Data Center used oil-filled transformers with insulating oil that serve as insulators and coolants but switched to mold transformers that use epoxy resin for insulation and cooling. Mold transformers are space efficient, allowing for high-efficiency designs within same volume areas. The replacement resulted in 304 tons of GHG emission reductions.

## Cooling Towers

Data Centers use cooling towers to effectively remove the heat generated from large capacity chillers. Previous closed-type chillers isolate cooling liquids from the atmosphere and has an advantage in terms of being less affected by external contamination. However, such closed-type cooling towers use brines (EG solutions) to prevent freezing in the winter which requires a separate process for discharging or disposal to prevent environmental pollution, as well as an additional feed water pump that results in more energy consumption than open-type cooling towers. The Suwon Data Center replaced its closed-type cooling towers with high-efficiency open-types that can be controlled based on cooling loads and reduced around 952 tons of GHG emissions.

## Temperature and Humidity Chambers

Most of the electrical energy used by IT equipment in computing is emitted as heat energy which is why large capacity cooling facilities are essential at data centers. The temperature and humidity chamber supplies cool air inside server rooms, but previous models with fixed-speed fans could not be controlled based on cooling loads and had heavy energy consumption. Replacing these outdated models with temperature-based control high-efficiency models, the Suwon Data Center reduced around 1,494 tons of GHG emissions.

## Energy Conservation

Samsung SDS is setting an example in energy conservation at business sites by turning off indoor lighting an hour earlier (21:00 → 20:00) and carrying out campaigns to turn off computers and monitors. On the 2023 Earth Day in April, we also participated in the nationwide Earth Hour event to raise employee awareness on energy conservation. Samsung SDS is taking the lead in ESG management through such actions, encouraging employees to take time off and also striving to reduce light pollution at the same time.

Samsung SDS is pursuing transition to renewable energy at its domestic and global operations and plans to switch to Green Premiums 1) and REC 2) in the short term, considering factors such as the quantity and price (economic feasibility) of renewable energy. In the mid-to-long-term, we plan to expedite the transition to renewable energy by concurrently participating in PPA 3) and equity investments 4) through external partnerships.

1) Green Premium: Program where a premium is paid on top of existing electricity bills to purchase renewable energy

2) REC (Renewable Energy Certificates): Program for purchasing renewable energy certificates (indirect purchase system)

3) PPA (Power Purchase Agreement): Agreements between power generators and companies on the direct purchase and contracting of renewable energy (long-term agreements)

4) Equity investment: Procuring renewable energy through a separate contract after making equity investments in renewable energy power generation businesses

ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE

## Management's Role and Responsibilities regarding Climate Risks and Opportunities

The critical responsibility for Samsung SDS' response to environmental and climate crises begins with the CEO (Chief Executive Officer) and CFO (Chief Financial Officer), who assess and manage climate-related risks and opportunities.

The CEO of Samsung SDS recognizes the impact of climate change on the overall company management as well as the impact of companies on external environments and stakeholders, in order to achieve sustainable growth of the company. In accordance with the Environment and Energy Management Principles established in 2023, the CEO regularly receives reports on the climate change response policy and progress in meeting targets to respond to the climate crisis and achieve carbon neutrality in the mid-to-long-term. In addition, the CEO supports the ESG Council to carry out its role in deliberating and making decisions on key agenda. The CFO of Samsung SDS not only manages the financial structure and business strategy, but also oversees overall environmental management issues as the executive in charge of environmental matters of the company to ensure the ESG strategy is carried out effectively by relevant businesses and departments. In addition, the CFO serves as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) that identifies and manages corporate risks to report identified climate risks and assessments to the BOD to support the CEO in making important business decisions.

## Analysis of Financial Impact from Transition Risk

Samsung SDS categorizes transition risks into policy/legal, technical, market, and reputational risks and quantifies the anticipated financial impact from a mid-to-long-term perspective. In particular, in the case of policy risks, we conducted a scenario analysis using S&P Global's methodology to increase the reliability of the analysis. First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts. Market risks were calculated by assessing the cost of switching to renewable energy in the power sector through analysis of the supply price of renewable energy, while reputational risks were analyzed based on the financial impact on revenues resulting from increased negative stakeholder feedback due to inadequate climate-related disclosure and greenwashing.

## Analysis on Financial Impact of Physical Risks

Samsung SDS has been using S&P Global's Climanomics framework since 2022 to identify and analyze financial impact of physical risks associated with the company's key assets. The scope of the analysis includes 30 assets including global data centers (owned and leased) and the headquarter and subsidiary offices. In line with the RCP scenario in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, annual average asset value loss rates and loss values were measured for the shortterm (2024), mid-term (2025~2029), and long-term (2030~2050), and each asset's exposure to 8 climate risks including urban flooding and extreme temperatures were identified.

Through the analysis, loss rates for assets under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has the highest climate risks, was forecast at 4.9% in 2030 and 7.3% in 2050. These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.

## Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario

Managing the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.

Of the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.

## Analysis of Climate related Business Opportunities

Samsung SDS' main business involves transition activities that contribute to the global 1.5°C goal. IEA 1) states in its 2023 Net-Zero Roadmap Report 2) that changing consumer behavior and responding to demand will enable CO$_{2}$ reductions of 2.6 Gt by 2050. The digital forwarding service of Samsung SDS, Cello Square, streamlines logistics operations and supports the transition to low-carbon transportation while Brity Meeting uses video conferencing to encourage behavioral changes in customers. GeSI 3) forecasts in its SMARTer2030 report that the revenue potential of ICT products and services will reach $1.8 trillion by 2030, while Markets&Markets predicts that the market for ESG disclosures and data platforms will grow at a CAGR of 16.5% from $700 million in 2022 to $1.5 billion in 2027.

In order to assess the climate opportunities for Samsung SDS and embed them in the business strategy, we defined low-carbon solutions that can contribute to lowering GHG emissions and adaptation. In addition, we assessed the suitability of our economic activities and calculated the net sales, CAPEX, and OPEX ratios of activities that contribute to climate change mitigation based on the EU Taxonomy standards. However, it is very difficult to quantify the short-, mid-, and long-term financial impacts of the low-carbon solutions defined by Samsung SDS and to conduct analysis of climate scenarios. This is because the data and research results required for reliable analysis have not been sufficiently accumulated, and the analysis methodology has not been established. The growth rate of low-carbon IT solutions is viewed very positively in a net-zero scenario but is not sufficient enough to be used as supporting evidence for the analysis.

For this reason, Samsung SDS will estimate and provide predictions on the potential market size and revenue fluctuations of low-carbon solutions based on market projections and mid-term revenue targets of each service that are incorporated in building business plans and further refine analysis methods.

## Water Resource Management

## Water Resource Management System

Samsung SDS recognizes the management of water resources as a key activity needed to create a sustainable future. We are committed to contributing to environmental protection through water conservation and minimizing environmental consequences by taking appropriate measures to treat used water.

## Water Resources Management Policies

We review the increase and decrease of water usage at all of our business sites, checking on the cause of such changes, and building mitigation measures to continuously manage quality and volume and ensure clean and stable water supply.

ENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE

## Water Consumption Reduction

Samsung SDS adopts water reduction systems starting from the designing stages of its domestic and global business sites to manage water usage effectively. We apply water-reducing designs and technologies for data centers to carry out optimal water resource management. The Sangam Data Center leverages local chilled water (12°C) which is excellent for cooling as it is around 5°C lower than general water temperatures while having less dissipation, there -by contributing to water conservation. The free cooling method used at Sangam also helps our efforts in reducing water usage.

## Water Consumption

## Water Consumption and Treatment

Most of the water used by Samsung SDS is domestic water which is discharged to public sewage treatment plants after simple screening at business sites. We closely monitor the entire process to ensure safe disposal, especially as coolants and antifreeze liquids used at our data centers for equipment maintenance (chillers, boiler cleaning, etc.) are water pollutants and handled through professional vendors for designated waste.

## Water Resource Management

## Water Resources Risk Assessment

Samsung SDS analyzed water-related risks using the Aqueduct Water Risk Framework provided by the WRI (World Resource Institute) based on the location of each of our business sites. Risks were categorized into physical risks related to quantity, physical risks related to quality, and regulatory and reputational risks based on the nature of the risk, and then broken down again into the 5 levels of Low, Low-Medium, Medium-High, High, and Extremely High depending on their level of impact.

## Categorization of Water Risks

## Physical Risks Related to Quantity

Physical risks related to quantity refer to risks that come from an oversupply of shortage of water resources.

·Water stress: Ratio of available water supply compared to water demand (measuring water withdrawal for both consumption and non-consumption purposes)

·Water Depletion: Ratio of water supply compared to water demand (similar to water stress but only based on consumption-based water withdrawal)

·Inter-annual variability : Average annual variation of available water supply

·Seasonal variability: Average water availability variability within a year

·Groundwater table decline: Average annual decrease rate of groundwater

·Riverine flood risk: Ratio of population affected by river inundations from floods

·Coastal flood risk: Ratio of population affected by from coastal floods

·Drought risk: Population and assets exposed to possible droughts and risks

## Physical Risks Related to Quality

Physical risks related to quality refer to risks regarding poor water quality that make it unavailable for use.

·Untreated connected wastewater: Ratio of domestic wastewater that has not gone through preliminary treatment

·Coastal eutrophication potential: Possibility of harmful algal blooms due to accumulated nitrogen, phosphorous, and silicon

## Regulatory and Reputational Risks

Regulatory and reputational risks refer to risks associated with uncertainties in regulatory changes and risk of undermined reputation due to water resource issues.

·Unimproved/No drinking water: Ratio of population that obtain drinking water from unprotected water wells, rivers, or lakes, etc.

·Unimproved/No sanitation: Ratio of population that directly dispose of human waste in non-hygiene areas or as solid waste

## Risk Assessment Outcome

Overall, Samsung SDS' domestic business sites were found to have a low-medium level water risk, whereas its overseas businesses sites showed high risks in China, Vietnam, and India, but relatively lower risks in the US, Europe, Singapore, and South America. However, this risk analysis is simply based on data using WRI's own tool and may differ from the actual water resource management status of our business sites.

## Waste Management

## Waste Management System

Samsung SDS established a waste management system in 2023 with waste management metrics based on business site and type of waste, working hard to reduce general waste, a major source of waste, from business sites by managing the total amount of waste disposal. In 2023, we started efforts to cut down on use of disposable products not only for recycling, but also to fundamentally lower waste volume, and are actively conducting campaigns led by the corporate and business-level environmental departments based on various ideas to engage employee participation.

## Designation of target business sites

- All Samsung SDS' business sites

* Subject to legal management: 5 data centers (Suwon/Sangam/Dongtan/Chuncheon/Gumi), West Campus, East Campus, Seoul R&D Campus, Pangyo IT Campus, Pangyo Logistics Campus, Giheung Tera Tower

## Scope of waste

- Business site waste, designated waste, recyclable waste

## Waste calculation system

- Business site waste: Volume-based general waste bags

- Designated waste: Allbaro system data

- Recyclable waste: Scaled weight

## Management of waste recycling, landfill, and incineration rates (ESG evaluation item)

- Building standards for managing waste at each business site

- External advisory and verification from professional waste certifiers

## Waste Reduction Activities

## RE:DUCE

Samsung SDS is taking the lead in practicing environmental protection through a Zero Plastic Campaign at its inhouse cafes to reduce the use of disposable products. The RE:DUCE campaign promotes use of personal cups at the company cafes which consume 600 thousand disposable goods a year in order to reduce overall use of disposable goods within the company. Following the campaign, average daily usage of personal cups by employees increased by 5-fold, and plastic straws were replaced with biodegradable straws which also helped lower use of disposable products.

## RE:CYCLE

Samsung SDS is conducting a RE:CYCLE campaign to collect and recycle used coffee capsules within the company. Building a consensus among employees on the need to recycle coffee capsules that were being thrown away as general waste, we partnered with NESPRESSO to start this campaign in November 2023. Since the start of the campaign, over 50,000 capsules have been retrieved and recycled, contributing to the reduction of approximately 190kgCO$_{2}$eq of GHG emissions. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide annually absorbed by 22 pine trees surviving for 30 years.

In 2022, campaigns were held to facilitate horizontal communication and build a culture of mutual respect by encouraging everyone to speak honorific language to each other, practice global meeting etiquettes, and give compliments and gratitude to colleagues.

## Employee Appraisals

Samsung SDS conducts biannual employee appraisals. Early in the year, the evaluator and evaluatee discuss and set individual targets together based on each employee's work function using measurable quantitative figures, as much as possible, to guarantee fair and objective evaluations. When the evaluate undergoes a change in work responsibilities or department transfer, targets may be revised throughout the year. Evaluators encourage evaluatees to meet their targets and help them address difficulties faced along the way through regular interviews before, during, and after the appraisal. In addition, frequent feedback is shared to monitor progress during the year and to deliver input to support strengthening capabilities. When the evaluate has an objection to the appraisal outcome, ratings can be adjusted following deliberation by the Appraisal Objection Review Committee. We also provide tiered compensation based on the results of individual performance evaluations to enhance employee work efficiency.

To enhance credibility and fairness in evaluations, Samsung SDS operates frequent feedback and peer reviews.

## Survey on Recognizing Change in the Organizational Culture(CCT)

In 2023, a field-led activity titled CCT (Change our Culture Together) was carried out to improve our organizational culture. Through biannual surveys on our corporate culture, inefficiencies and unreasonable practices in work were identified and opinion were gathered on how to enhance mutual respect and improve department culture such as in the way work is done. Following the survey, department leaders and members implemented improvement measures tailored to the situation of their respective departments. When additional improvement was needed, weak points were identified and consulting to propose customized solutions were also offered.

## Change Agent

## Supply Chain ESG

## Supply Chain ESG Roadmap

With the goal of establishing a supply chain ESG ecosystem, Samsung SDS is building and expanding its supply chain ESG management system. We are working hard to strengthen the ESG management capabilities of suppliers while complying with global ESG laws and standards and fulfilling our social responsibilities .


<!-- image -->

## Dedicated Organization for Supply Chain ESG

Samsung SDS has a dedicated organization for supply chain ESG management to strengthen independence and expertise in carrying out inspections and support for the sustainability management systems of suppliers. In addition, supplier ESG engagement rates are embedded in the KPI of the Partner Collaboration Team (procurement).

## Creating a Sustainable Supply Chain

To build a sustainable supply chain, Samsung SDS has established Supplier's ESG Code of Conduct (standard) that reflects the UNGPs (UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights), the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and OECD guidelines for multinational corporations that include supply chains. Based on the standards, ESG levels of suppliers are checked through a systematic process that includes receiving compliance agreements to the Code of Conduct, self-inspections, site inspections, and third-party assurance (operations) to make necessary improvements and strengthen capabilities (follow-up). In addition, the basic agreements with suppliers shall contain clauses on social responsibilities (compliance with Code of Conduct)) and be signed through the procurement system.

## Managing Suppliers' Climate Actions

To manage environmental information of suppliers, Samsung SDS joined the CDP's (Carbon Disclosure Project) Supply Chain Program to gather information on GHG emissions and renewable energy consumption aligned with CDP standards. As of 2023, 53 suppliers are taking part in the CDP Supply Chain Program. In addition, ESG consulting carried out guides on calculating GHG emissions to strengthen the GHG management of suppliers. Along with training on GHG mitigation awareness, GHG calculations will be performed at selected key suppliers in 2024 to identify best practices and continuously cascade to other suppliers.

## Self-inspection

Samsung SDS has developed and distributed 50 self-check items based on the Code of Conduct that sets the direction for supply chain ESG to suppliers. Depending on their respective sectors, suppliers carry out annual self-inspections consisting of 45 questions. Prior to distribution, suppliers receive training on how to conduct the self-inspections, understanding the direction for supply chain ESG management, and new inspection questions while Q&A sessions are also set aside to encourage interactive communication.

## On-site inspection

The dedicated supply chain ESG organization, that carries out independent verification functions, is responsible for performing on-site inspections of suppliers. To rigorously scrutinize the work environment of suppliers, Samsung SDS identifies issues and formulate short- and mid-to-long-term initiatives based on feedback from suppliers. Immediate corrections are made for issues that can be improved on-site while other issues are monitored based o the supplier's improvement plans. We also provide an implementation guide along with training on each specific item to contribute to enhancing the level of ESG management of our suppliers. In particular, we are supporting suppliers with detailed guidelines to prepare them for changes in internal and external ESG focus areas such as activities to increase supplier diversity and joining the effort to respond to climate change.

## Listening to Supplier Feedback

There are 3 points in the evaluation process to listen to supplier opinions. Thanks to such interactive communication with suppliers, supplier ESG engagement rates have reached over 90% during the past 3 years.

## 1. Briefing on the management system prior to evaluations (annual, Q1)

Meeting with management and employees in charge of ESG at the supplier that serves as a venue for gathering supplier input on the management system to be implemented in the given year

## 2. On-site during evaluations (for on-site inspections) (annual, Q3)

Meeting during on-site inspections to answer each supplier's ESG questions and address challenges they face leveraging based on a question list prepared in advance

3. Feedback on improvement areas when sharing evaluation results after the evaluation (annual, Q3) Meeting to share evaluation outcomes and areas that need improvement. Feedback is gathered and incorporated in the management systems for the following year

## Managing Improvements through Third-Party Inspections (secondary audit)

Samsung SDS carries out third-party inspections on selected key suppliers 1) based on advanced checklists to identify and manage ESG risks in the supply chain. Inspections are carried out over two rounds of audits where on-site improvements that can be made through immediate corrections were made during the 1 st audit, and improvements that require mid-to-long-term initiatives were checked during the 2 nd audit. As a result, average scores were 15.8% higher in the 2 nd audit compared to the 1 st round. Four suppliers with the high scores in the 2 nd audit were given Supplier with ESG Excellence Certification plaques while 10 suppliers that exceeded an improvement rate thresholds were given Certificates of ESG Management Supplier to motivate suppliers and recognize their efforts in enhancing ESG management.

1) Key suppliers: Companies with substantial impact on supply chain ESG risks and on Samsung SDS (suppliers with trade volume and share that reach a certain level and have improvement areas drawn out during on-site inspections, etc.)

## ESG Training and Reinforcement of Supplier ESG Competencies

In line with global standards such as recent demands from the EU supply chain audit requirements and ESG reporting criteria, Samsung SDS plans and operates ESG training programs for suppliers aligned with ESG policies to effectively respond to changes in the ESG management environment.

Through surveys conducted prior to training, we listen to supplier questions submitted anonymously to reflect them in training programs. In addition, guidebooks on Samsung SDS ESG policies are made each year with a detailed guide that incorporates key improvement areas for 2023, that is also shared with suppliers. Consulting to strengthen ESG competencies was also carried out for 20 Korean SMEs in partnership with KODATA, a leading corporate credit bureau in Korea.

Through such competency reinforcement programs, average scores of on-site inspections have continuously improved over the past 3 years.

## Fair Trade Policy

In order to establish a culture pf transparency and fair trade with suppliers, Samsung SDS adopts 4 key principles for fair trade to comply with relevant legislations such as the Subcontract Act to strive to prevent unfair practices from occurring transactions with suppliers.

## 4 Fair Trade Principles

## Supplier Selection

## 1. Faithfully implement contracting process

We adopt and operate the Fair Trade Commission's 'Good Contract Execution Practices,' taking the lead in building an environment for reasonable and fair trade and shared growth.

## 2. Select and manage suppliers

We secure fairness and transparency in the selection and management of suppliers, and operate reasonable and transparent supplier management policies.

## 3. Set up and manage the Subcontractor Transaction Review Committee

We comply with the fairness and legitimacy of subcontract transactions through prior deliberation of subcontract transactions that exceed a certain level.

## 4. Issue and retain printed documents

We take the lead in establishing a fair trade order by introducing the Fair Trade Commission's principles on issuing and retaining printed contracts with subcontractors.

## Fair Trade and Contract Agreements

Samsung SDS includes the Code of Ethical Management in all subcontractor contracts to prevent unfair trade and fraudulent acts that may occur in the course of business with suppliers. We participated in a joint taskforce between the public and private sectors on improving standard subcontracting practices in the software business in 2012 and adopted standard subcontracting contracts recommended by the Fair Trade Commission that is currently applied to 4 software business sectors, 4 construction sectors, and 2 logistics sectors. In addition, we introduced electronic contracts through smart-together.com, our supplier portal, to prevent unfair trade practices such as verbal orders and unfair order cancellations.

Suppliers are selected and managed based on the 4 fair trade principles to select partners in a fair and transparent manner. Supplier selection criteria and procedures are notified through smart-together.com with specific and precise descriptions of our selection and evaluation standards to ensure there are no concerns of arbitrary interpretations by suppliers.

Samsung SDS is the only Korean company to have obtained the highest certification grade since the certification program was launched in 2009. High quality software processes imply that the entire software development process is consistent from beginning to end and is being continuously improved to offer better services. The granted SP certification grade is the result of assessment of project activities executed by the given company with Grade 2 meaning project management, development, and support areas meet industry standards. Grade 3, however, requires organization management and process improvements to be carried out, as well. Grade 2 assessments review project management (planning, control, and supplier management), development (specification management, analysis, design, deployment, and testing), and support (quality assurance, configuration management, measurement and analysis), and Grade 3 assessments include organization management (organization process management, member training) and process improvements (organizational performance management, problem-solving, process improvement management). Samsung SDS is committed to further enhancing quality capabilities grounded on processes, methodologies, and systems to earn trust from customers.

## Corporate Governance

## Board of Directors

## Board Composition

Samsung SDS' Board of Directors (BOD) is composed and operated in line with applicable laws and the Articles of Incorporation, ensuring transparent and independent governance. At the 39th General Shareholders' Meeting in March 2024, one independent director and two executive directors were appointed, following recommendations from the Independent Director Recommendation Committee and BOD with the appointment process for each director conducted in accordance with relevant laws. In order to enhance efficiency in BOD operations and decision-makings, President Sungwoo Hwang was reappointed as CEO and BOD Chair through Board resolution in accordance with Article 33 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 5 of the BOD Regulations. In addition, efforts have been made continuously to strengthen accountable management led by the Board such as introducing the senior independent director system in October 2023. Currently, the BOD is composed of 3 executive directors and 4 independent directors which is pursuant to Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act that stipulates that there should be 3 or more outside directors with the number of outside directors making up the majority of directors.

## Senior Independent Director

The senior(lead) independent director system, mandated at financial firms such as banks, provides checks and balances by appointing a senior independent director to represent independent directors at boards where the CEO or executive director is chair. Samsung SDS is not subject to this mandatory rule as it is not a financial firm but adopted the senior independent director system in October 2023 to strengthen BOD independence and governance transparency and appointed Hyun-Han Shin as the senior independent director. The senior independent director may convene and hold meetings and gatherings of independent directors and facilitate communication between the BOD chair, management members and independent directors.

## Corporate Governance

## Board of Directors

## Strengthening Board Independence

Samsung SDS has a majority of independent directors to ensure independence of the BOD and operates meetings that encourage open discussions and independent decision-making. In addition, transactions between directors and the company are restricted and directors who have an interest in a BOD resolution are prohibited from exercising their voting rights in order to minimize conflicts of interest. We form a pool of candidates by examining factors such as qualifications, business experience, and interests with the company to ensure fairness and independence in the appointment of directors while the BOD and Independent Director Recommendation Committee comprehensively consider evaluation criteria for individual candidates including expertise, social recognition, and integrity along with Board diversity, and the business environment at the time of appointment to select candidates. In addition, the Independent Director Recommendation Committee will meet once a year from 2024 onward to reinforce operations. This year, the committee meet on April 25 with all of its members attending to review candidates and discuss the direction for committee operations going forward.

## Board Diversity and Expertise

Samsung SDS composes its BOD with directors who have diverse expertise to enable strategic decision-makings from a comprehensive perspective. The CEO, a leading expert in IT services, oversees the overall business and drives responsible management as the BOD chair. Furthermore, we appoint experts with deep knowledge and experience in various fields such as law, IT, finance, and business strategy as independent directors who provide objective management supervision and professional advice. Independent directors are limited to holding dual positions at one company to ensure their expertise and loyalty. Samsung SDS is committed to growing alongside its stakeholders and advocates diversity factors such as gender, age, nationality, education, and political affiliation, etc.

## Board Convocation

Convocation of BOD meetings shall be carried out by the BOD Chair in accordance with Article 33 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 9 of the BOD Regulations with the Chair notifying each director one week before the meeting. Individual directors are entitled to request the Chair to convene a BOD meeting when giving a clear agenda and reasons. If the Chair refuses convocation without a justifiable cause, the respective director may directly call a BOD meeting. While the BOD meeting shall convene quarterly, temporary BOD meetings may be held when necessary. In 2023, 9 BOD meetings were convened to deliberate and decide on a total 29 agenda items.

## Board Resolution

Pursuant to Article 35 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 10 of the BOD Regulations, BOD resolutions are made with the attendance of a majority of enrolled directors and with the consent of a majority of the attended directors (unless otherwise prescribed in relevant laws). Participation in resolutions by all or some directors of the Board without attending the meeting in person is permitted through telecommunications devices that allow voices of all of the directors to be transmitted and received simultaneously. In such cases, the director is considered as attending the BOD meeting in person. Each director's attendance rate and approval or disapproval for key agenda items that require disclosure are disclosed in the Business Report.

## Board Evaluation

Independent directors are evaluated regularly on an annual basis based on their individual activities and performance using evaluation criteria consisting of quantitative indicators such as BOD and committee meeting attendance rates and number of agenda items deliberated, and qualitative indicators such as expertise and understanding of the business. The evaluation results are leveraged as a key metric in determining reappointment.

## Support for Independent Directors

Samsung SDS designates a supporting department to provide independent directors with the information and resources needed to carry out their roles effectively. We also regularly share and update the company's business plan and key business issues with independent directors to enhance their understanding of our business.

## Board Committees

## Committee Operations

The BOD has a total 6 committees as stipulated in Article 34 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 14 of the BOD Regulations and delegates the authority of the BOD to ensure quick and efficient decision-making. The BOD enacts and stipulates regulations for committee operations through BOD resolution, detailing the organization, operations, and authority of each committee. Committee resolutions are notified to all directors within 2 business days, and each notified director may request a BOD meeting to the BOD chair within 3 business days from the date of notification, when deemed necessary. In this case, the BOD may adjudicate the resolutions made by the committee. However, resolutions made by the Audit Committee are excluded from such adjudication to guarantee independence of the audit body. Moreover, the Independent Director Recommendation Committee and Related Party Transactions Committee which each previously included one executive director, improved its independence and are composed only of independent directors starting in 2024.

## Risk Management

## Risk Management System

## Risk Governance

Samsung SDS frequently monitors risks associated with the role of each BOD committee and builds a risk management strategy to respond accordingly. In addition, the CFO is designated as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and holds a Risk Management Council where relevant departments participate to share identified risks and devise countermeasures. The Risk Management Council manages and develops policies to address all types of risks including financial risks such as market, credit, and liquidity risks, as well as operational risks such as compliance, human rights, safety, and environmental risks, operating relevant programs through each responsible department.

The Risk Management Council manages risks through impact analysis of risks with potential losses and by implementing appropriate responses while reporting material risks to the BOD and its committees to reflect it in the business strategy. In addition, relevant departments manage financial and non-financial risks across all business stages. In particular, we have a system in place for emerging risks in technology and services to be shared immediately with the dedicated organization and relevant departments to respond promptly.

## CPMS(Compliance Program Management System)

To support employees' continuous compliance activities, we have established and operated a compliance management platform called CPMS. CPMS provides various information such as an operating system, guidelines, latest trends, and FAQs related to compliance management, allowing employees to become familiar with compliance requirements. It also offers real-time inquiry and response, self-inspection, and reporting functions. Notably, it operates a 'My Compliance Index' system that indicates the level of compliance activity based on system-based compliance activities, thereby continuously spreading a compliance culture.

## Law Bot

Samsung SDS operates a chatbot to enable employees to access compliance guidelines regarding their work anywhere, anytime. It is being actively used for various employee compliance activities including viewing personal CPMS indexes, accessing compliance guides, taking self-checks, signing compliance pledges, participating in training, and learning about legal violations and sanction cases. A feedback feature (to make inquiries) has also been newly added, so employees can receive answers to their questions in real-time.

## Security Verification

Samsung SDS established a software security verification system with specialized verification procedures for each stage to minimize security vulnerabilities in system and product developments and ensure safe software development. Verification is carried out across the entire process from security design to source code, open source, application systems and infrastructure, to services, prior to launch or before services are opened, allowing transfer to operations only when passing verification standards.


<!-- image -->

After discussing the security verification department and development departments, security checks are performed for each area, taking into account the characteristics of the verification target. If any vulnerabilities are discovered, they are re-verified to confirm if appropriate measures have been taken. In 2023, we conducted 388 security verifications on products and services, and followed up by monitoring any identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, we have embedded security throughout the entire software lifecycle using the DevSecOps system, which allows us to take immediate action and make improvements whenever security vulnerabilities are detected during the development phase through automated continuous security checks. Finally, we provide a dashboard that visualizes the current security level and remaining vulnerabilities, making it easier to improve security and quality levels.

## Mock Hacking

Samsung SDS operates an independent and professional department that carries out mock hacking on internal systems, products, and solutions. The simulations help nurture security experts with hacking skills by operating mock hacking on all systems developed and operated by the company at least once a year. The exercise allows actual hacking tools and techniques to be used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or steal information which helps identify system vulnerabilities and take measures for the identified vulnerabilities to prevent security accidents.

## 2023 Mock Hacking Outcomes


|   Mock Hacking Target |   Inspection Rate |   Vulnerabilities Identified | Action completion rate   |
|-----------------------|-------------------|------------------------------|--------------------------|

## Cloud Security

In response to the rapidly evolving business environment, Samsung SDS has established an optimized cloud work environment based on the Samsung Cloud Platform (SCP) to secure new competitiveness through cloudbased digital transformation. Acting as a cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud management service provider (MSP), we conduct various activities to ensure a robust cloud security system. Samsung SDS prioritizes the introduction of an SCP-based Identity Access Management (IAM) solution, or Single ID, the development of various Software as a Service (SaaS)-type endpoint security solutions, and the automation of malware detection and security measures leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. Owing to these efforts, Samsung SDS' cloud security capabilities have gained international recognition, receiving accolades such as the Security Company of the Year from Frost & Sullivan for three consecutive years (2020-2022). In 2022, we were recognized as a major player in the worldwide cloud security services market by IDC, as reported in their IDC MarketScape Cloud Security Services Report.

## Cloud Security Inspections

With the increase in cloud environments, Samsung SDS has developed new security guides for each type of cloud and shared it with employees to provide standards for building and using safe cloud environments. In addition, we prepared a separate checklist for the cloud environment and are expanding inspection targets and automatic inspections to strengthen management of a safe cloud environment. Inspection scopes were expanded in 2023 to include a total 25 public cloud services used by 3 of our subsidiaries in inspections and identified 172 vulnerabilities. Immediate action was taken on 109 substantial items and are taking continuous measures and improvements on other items with weak security management for ongoing improvement and management of the cloud security environment.

## Risk Management

The Information Security Department identifies potential security risks by analyzing the internal and external environment and internal security inspection results, and determines their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability losses regarding all of our information assets. Based on the impact analysis, a risk assessment is carried out at least once a year to analyze security vulnerabilities for each information asset type. We manage the identified risks through a process where strategies and protection measures are selected with relevant departments and officers, and implementation plans are built and reported to management to confirm whether measures are taken. During risk assessments in the following year, mitigation of risks identified in the previous year are reassessed which is included in the Risk Assessment Report submitted each year for external certification and audits on information security practices for objective evaluation. In 2023, 10 risks were identified, and actions have been completed based on the protection measures which have been reflected in the information security management system.

## Backup Management

Samsung SDS has established and operates a detailed backup policy to prepare against data damage and service disruption caused by disasters or security incidents. As the threat of attacks on backup systems has increased recently, detailed security guides and checklists for backup systems have been prepared and distributed. Accordingly, periodic inspections are conducted for each business division to ensure that security levels such as access control and authorization management for backup system administration accounts, network configuration, and log management are being managed at a level similar to that of the operating system. In 2023, the inspection scope for backup servers was expanded from domestic business sites to backup systems of overseas subsidiaries, and the found vulnerabilities were fixed.

## Business Continuity Plan for Systems

We have established and operated 'Business Continuity Management' guidelines with common standards for preparing against natural disasters and security incidents that can occur despite various prevention management activities. A department dedicated to disaster and accident prevention and response has been formed, and the person in charge of each system establishes a business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems, we establish detailed processes for establishing and operating a DR center and manage implementation status. To determine whether the business continuity plan established by each service is appropriate, mock training is conducted at least once a half term for each department for infringement accidents, personal information leakage accidents, or disasters. The plan is supplemented if necessary according to the results to prepare minimizing the impact in the event of an actual accident or disaster. In particular, considering that the DMZ zone system, which is open to the Internet, has a high impact in the event of an accident, the effectiveness of the applied security control items is also verified through mock control training. In 2023, web shell attacks were conducted for 31 services in the first and second half of the year, and the response process was improved by analyzing the results.

## Response to Security Incidents

Samsung SDS operates a dedicated department and process for handling security incidents. As part of our corporate information security policies, we have a 'Security Incident Response' guideline that defines response and follow-up measures for incidents classified based on degree of impact with specific procedures being developed and operated by the Incident Response Department. In the event of a security incident, the dedicated department quickly forward the case to relevant departments to minimize impact while material incidents are reported to management to ensure there are no issues in the response measures taken. Afterwards, the cause of the incident is analyzed, and preventive measures are devised along with a review of the response process to incorporate necessary improvements going forward. The Corporate Information Security Department also reviews security incidents and process improvements to revise the 'security incident response' guideline twice a year, once in the first half and once in the second half of the year, to ensure effective response systems are in pace to address potential incidents.
