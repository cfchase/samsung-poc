## **RE:DUCE**

Samsung SDS is taking the lead in practicing environmental protection through a Zero Plastic Campaign at its inhouse cafes to reduce the use of disposable products. The RE:DUCE campaign promotes use of personal cups at the company cafes which consume 600 thousand disposable goods a year in order to reduce overall use of disposable goods within the company. Following the campaign, average daily usage of personal cups by employees increased by 5-fold, and plastic straws were replaced with biodegradable straws which also helped lower use of disposable products.

## **ZERO Disposables Challenge**

Taking part in the 'ZERO Disposables Challenge' promoted by the Ministry of Environment, Samsung SDS CEO delivered a message on practicing eco-friendly management and reducing use of disposable products. We will continue to spearhead efforts in environmental management through such challenges based on our ESG slogan.
