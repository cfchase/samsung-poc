## **Creating a Sustainable Supply Chain**

To build a sustainable supply chain, Samsung SDS has established Supplier's ESG Code of Conduct (standard) that reflects the UNGPs (UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights), the ILO Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work, and OECD guidelines for multinational corporations that include supply chains. Based on the standards, ESG levels of suppliers are checked through a systematic process that includes receiving compliance agreements to the Code of Conduct, self-inspections, site inspections, and third-party assurance (operations) to make necessary improvements and strengthen capabilities (follow-up). In addition, the basic agreements with suppliers shall contain clauses on social responsibilities (compliance with Code of Conduct)) and be signed through the procurement system.

## **Managing Suppliers' Climate Actions**

To manage environmental information of suppliers, Samsung SDS joined the CDP's (Carbon Disclosure Project) Supply Chain Program to gather information on GHG emissions and renewable energy consumption aligned with CDP standards. As of 2023, 53 suppliers are taking part in the CDP Supply Chain Program. In addition, ESG consulting carried out guides on calculating GHG emissions to strengthen the GHG management of suppliers. Along with training on GHG mitigation awareness, GHG calculations will be performed at selected key suppliers in 2024 to identify best practices and continuously cascade to other suppliers.
