Samsung SDS is actively carrying out various accident prevention and compliance activities through the field-oriented Smart Safety Management System (SSMS). In 2023, we increased developments of overseas features to apply SSMS to overseas subsidiaries to thoroughly implement accident prevention and post-incident follow-up measures. We continue to develop such functions and plan to expand SSMS overseas coverage by 2027.

In addition, as we recognize the importance of safety and health at subsidiaries, Samsung SDS plans to gradually expand the safety and health management system of headquarters to both domestic and overseas subsidiaries in 2024 followed with relevant consulting and support in 2025 to ensure the management systems are well maintained.

## **Strengthen Supply Chain ESG**

Managing ESG in the supply chain is the key to managing ESG risks. Therefore, Samsung SDS continues to expand activities to identify, improve, and prevent ESG related risks in the supply chain. In addition, we will apply our headquarters' supply chain ESG management system to not only our domestic subsidiaries, but also our overseas subsidiaries to fundamentally manage ESG risks along the supply chain. By doing so, we aim to ultimately contribute to society through the setup of a sustainable ESG supply chain ecosystem.

## **Performance and Next Steps**

We are working to evaluate our suppliers through a systematic process from planning, implementation, assessment, improvements, and monitoring, etc. and to ensure that ESG values are embedded across our entire business from the selection of suppliers to collaborating with them. In 2023, we established a team dedicated to supply chain ESG to strengthen independence and professionalism and to review the sustainability management systems of our suppliers.
