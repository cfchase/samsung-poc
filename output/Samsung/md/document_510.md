## **Response to Security Incidents**

Samsung SDS operates a dedicated department and process for handling security incidents. As part of our corporate information security policies, we have a 'Security Incident Response' guideline that defines response and follow-up measures for incidents classified based on degree of impact with specific procedures being developed and operated by the Incident Response Department. In the event of a security incident, the dedicated department quickly forward the case to relevant departments to minimize impact while material incidents are reported to management to ensure there are no issues in the response measures taken. Afterwards, the cause of the incident is analyzed, and preventive measures are devised along with a review of the response process to incorporate necessary improvements going forward. The Corporate Information Security Department also reviews security incidents and process improvements to revise the 'security incident response' guideline twice a year, once in the first half and once in the second half of the year, to ensure effective response systems are in pace to address potential incidents.
