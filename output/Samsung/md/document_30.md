## **Climate Action**

## **GHG Emissions Reduction at Data Centers**

Samsung SDS strives to reduce carbon emissions and operate sustainable business by carrying out various activities to curb GHG emissions. The Chuncheon Data Center extended the period of adopting free cooling by adjusting its temperature for free cooling from 2022 and switched the base criteria from temperatures to humidity in 2023 which reduced GHG emissions by around 432 tons. The Dongtan Data Center which opened in 2023 maintains server room temperatures relatively higher than typical data centers, reducing energy consumption by only relying on cooling towers for 70% of the time throughout the year. We will continue to seek ways such as leveraging solar power facilities to operate more energy-efficient data centers.
