## **DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion)**

Samsung SDS respects the diversity of all members that belong to its headquarters, subsidiaries, and overseas subsidiaries. We do not tolerate discrimination of any kind against our employees, whether it is against gender, race, nationality, religion, age, or disability, etc., and are committed to providing an inclusive environment where everyone is treated fairly and equally. We offer training and organizational culture activities to all of our employees to raise awareness on DEI and build a consensus while strengthening our support for female workers and the disabled. In addition, we are implementing DEI policies that embrace the different cultures and nature of the countries in which we operate.

## **Organizational Culture**

Various activities related to organizational culture are being carried out our headquarters and overseas subsidiaries to build a culture that respects and embraces diversity.

## **Building a Culture of Mutual Respect through Horizontal Communication**

In 2019, Samsung SDS restructured the company hierarchy, reducing the number of career levels from 6 to 4 and removing job titles when addressing each other such as by using English names, instead. In 2022, campaigns were held to facilitate horizontal communication and build a culture of mutual respect by encouraging everyone to speak honorific language to each other, practice global meeting etiquettes, and give compliments and gratitude to colleagues.

## **Diagnosis on the Organization's Inclusive Culture**

The Samsung Culture Index (SCI) survey was renewed in 2022, adding questions on DEI. Through the survey, we plan to continue to improve inclusivity in our organizational culture by listening to the thoughts of our employees.
