We are working to build a sound culture of sharing and growing together with local communities, engaging in various employee volunteer services including the Volunteer Festival on the occasion of the company's anniversary (Apr), Samsung's Sharing Week with all Samsung affiliates (Nov), hands-on volunteering, blood donation campaigns, and production of IT training videos. In-person volunteering which was discontinued during the COVID-19 pandemic resumed in 2023 with individuals and departments actively volunteering in cleaning communities, helping rural communities, and distributing and delivering food to the disadvantaged. Furthermore, hands-on volunteering, where employees and their families make items first-hand to donate to vulnerable groups in Korea and abroad, and online IT mentoring, where employees share their SW and AI expertise and experiences, were well received by participants.
