The sustainability management system of suppliers assess all areas of ESG including labor rights, safety and the environment, business ethics, and management systems, and is scheduled to be extended to our subsidiaries along with supply chain evaluation systems in 2024.

Starting in 2025, we plan to gradually expand our supply chain ESG management system to overseas subsidiaries. By doing so, we plan to go beyond local supply chains in the regions where we do business simply complying with local laws and regulations and support building an environmentally and socially sustainable system.

## **Build a Digital Responsibility Management System**

The advance of cutting-edge IT technology makes life more convenient, but it also comes with strings attached. The spread of generative AI is especially grabbing attention as new issues such as deepfake technology and leak of personal information emerge. Samsung SDS is actively responding to such trends by defining AI ethics, personal information security, and open source policies as the three key pillars of the company's digital responsibility. We aim to fulfill our corporate social responsibility as an IT company by protecting our customers and stakeholders from various risks and issues caused by the introduction of new technology.

## **Performance and Next Steps**

Recently, the emergence of generative AI is triggering various social issues. In 2023, Samsung SDS launched a case study on AI governance systems and formed a company-wide digital responsibility task force. Following such efforts, we are currently building an AI governance system that reflects the 2024 international standards, best practices, and recommendations from global initiatives. Based on this system, we plan to apply an inspection system across the entire AI business lifecycle starting in 2025 and gradually expand it to our overseas subsidiaries in 2026. Through this, we will carry out rigorous review of the various risks that may be caused by the products and services provided by Samsung SDS.
