Launched in 2013, Samsung SDS has been leading the Samsung Junior SW Academy since 2022, operating the program in partnership with Samsung Electronics, Samsung Display, Samsung SDI, and Samsung Electro-Mechanics. The Academy offers software and artificial intelligence convergence education, fostering young talent for the AI era through the integration of various knowledge domains. To reinforce SW and AI capabilities of current educators, a teacher training program is operated twice a year during vacations, supporting schools in delivering high-quality SW and AI programs by working with education experts to develop and provide grade-specific curricula, SW and AI programming editors, and teaching materials. In addition, students are offered the opportunity to take part in special lectures by Samsung employees and online IT mentorships to help them outline their career aspirations. As of 2023, we have supported approximately 4,300 teachers and the growth of over 200,000 students, contributing to the expansion of SW and AI education in Korea.
