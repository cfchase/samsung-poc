## **Renewable Energy Procurement**

Samsung SDS is pursuing transition to renewable energy at its domestic and global operations and plans to switch to Green Premiums 1) and REC 2) in the short term, considering factors such as the quantity and price (economic feasibility) of renewable energy. In the mid-to-long-term, we plan to expedite the transition to renewable energy by concurrently participating in PPA 3) and equity investments 4) through external partnerships.

1) Green Premium: Program where a premium is paid on top of existing electricity bills to purchase renewable energy

2) REC (Renewable Energy Certificates): Program for purchasing renewable energy certificates (indirect purchase system)

3) PPA (Power Purchase Agreement): Agreements between power generators and companies on the direct purchase and contracting of renewable energy (long-term agreements)

4) Equity investment: Procuring renewable energy through a separate contract after making equity investments in renewable energy power generation businesses
