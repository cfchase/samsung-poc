The Information Security Policies apply not only to our employees, but also to partners and visitors who have access to the company's physical assets and information assets. In particular, areas that require compliance from partner compa -nies in each stage from the commencement to termination of contracts are specified in the guidelines, serving as the basis for information security standards in contracts to apply the same level of security standards applied to our em -ployees. This shall include signing security pledges, taking part in training, and conducting regular and adhoc security audits. Information security regulations and guidelines are reviewed at least once a year and revised with management approval to reflect law amendments, changes in the IT environment, and incident cases. As for corporations and sub -sidiaries, a framework is provided for information security policies to be devised based on the local environment and business situations of each subsidiary while staying within Samsung SDS' information security policy guidelines.

GOVERNANCE

## **Information Security Governance**

Samsung SDS appoints a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO), an executive responsible for overseeing all aspects of information security within the company. The CISO meets regularly with managers and leaders of information security departments from each business unit through the Information Security Management Council where internal and external risks are reviewed and key responsibilities of each department are shared. When deemed necessary, key decisions on the company's policies can be discussed and key issues and achievements resulting from the Council's meetings regarding security are reported to the CEO.

## **Security Management of Overseas Subsidiaries**

Security officers are dispatch to our 7 key overseas subsidiaries to delegate the responsibility of security management. The information security organization at headquarters holds regular meetings with the dispatched officers in the last week of each month to discuss the current status of each subsidiary and work together to address any potential security threats both domestically and abroad, ensuring compliance with global security standards.
