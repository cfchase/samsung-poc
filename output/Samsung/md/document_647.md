The NANUM Kiosk is a sponsorship program that leverages offline kiosks and an online website to share stories of underprivileged children and teens in need and to donate KRW 1,000 each time an employee tags their employee ID cards. Once the target donation amount is reached, the funds are delivered to our partner NGO, Good Neighbors, to sponsor children in the program with educational, medical, and living expenses. In 2023, donations worth a total KRW 140 million were donated to 28 children.

INTRODUCTION

## **Future IT Education Library**

Samsung SDS has been operating the Future IT Education Library with the Heart-Heart Foundation (NGO) since 2021 to address blind spots in IT education, providing IT educational equipment and on/offline contents to underserved children and teens in the information sector to spread self-sustaining IT education. Libraries have been set up at 16 locations, offering a wide range of equipment and digital ethics training related to AI, IoT, and the metaverse, as well making IT educational tools available to use and borrow.

## **SW Education and Scholarships for Youth at Detention Centers**

Samsung SDS partners with the Korea Juvenile Protection Association (NGO) to support youth at detention centers to become healthy and responsible members of society. Scholarships and gifts at the end of the year are provided to these youth who face difficulty adjusting to society after being released due to low education levels and unstable homes.

To offer more practical and long-term support, we are operating a basic software education program since 2023 with over 50 boys at detention centers in Seoul and Anyang taking part in learning block coding, text coding, and exploring careers related to software. In addition, scholarships are being given to selected participants wishing to work in the SW field or who hold relevant licenses to continuously strengthen their software skills.
