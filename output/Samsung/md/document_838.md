## **International Standard Certification on Open Source**

In July 2022, Samsung SDS became the first Korean IT service provider to obtain the International Standard Certification (ISO/IEC 5230:2020) from the OpenChain Project. This certification is awarded to companies with open source license compliance systems and capabilities by the OpenChain Project initiated by the Linux Foundation in 2016. Samsung SDS was recognized for its global competence across all areas of the open source compliance system including building open source policies and processes, securing professional talent, and training members of the company.

## **Strengthening Security in the Open Source Software Supply Chain**

SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is a formal record containing a list of the software's components and a detailed mapping of dependencies, serving as a key means to respond to security threats in the software supply chain. Samsung SDS applies an open source SBOM system to secure transparency and integrity in its software supply chain. Open source SBOMs are auto-generated, stored, and managed starting with solutions rolling out in 2023 to deliver visibility into software components and supply chain relationships, supporting analysis of security vulnerabilities and compliance with license terms.
