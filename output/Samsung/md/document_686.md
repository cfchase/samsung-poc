After discussing the security verification department and development departments, security checks are performed for each area, taking into account the characteristics of the verification target. If any vulnerabilities are discovered, they are re-verified to confirm if appropriate measures have been taken. In 2023, we conducted 388 security verifications on products and services, and followed up by monitoring any identified vulnerabilities. Additionally, we have embedded security throughout the entire software lifecycle using the DevSecOps system, which allows us to take immediate action and make improvements whenever security vulnerabilities are detected during the development phase through automated continuous security checks. Finally, we provide a dashboard that visualizes the current security level and remaining vulnerabilities, making it easier to improve security and quality levels.

## **Security Checks**

Samsung SDS operates a checklist based on years of knowhow to enhance information system management, prevent security accidents, and improve security reliability. Regular and ongoing security inspections are carried out on each area using this checklist based on a Zero Trust security system that conducts multilateral inspections on all items starting with the basics without trusting anything. The checklist is reviewed regularly to respond to new security threats and evolving IT technologies and business environment by discovering new items to check, as well as revising existing items.
