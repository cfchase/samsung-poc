## **Provide Eco-friendly Products and Services**

Samsung SDS supports the ESG management of customers with its IT technology and knowhow.

Clouds have lower energy consumption than on-premise infrastructure thanks to high density integration and energy efficient data centers using virtualization and resource-sharing technologies. In addition, analysis showed that companies can curb emissions by as much as 80% through cloud migration. Samsung SDS is contributing to the ESG management activities of customers by achieving significant carbon mitigations with the adoption of cloud services.

## **Support ESG Activities of our Customers through Cloud Services**

We launched a carbon dashboard in October 2023 that displays the status of carbon emissions to support ESG management at customers that use Samsung Cloud Platform (SCP).

·Features: Monthly emissions, emissions by product, monthly estimates, increase/decrease compared to previous month, monthly average, and monthly trends

## **Offer Customized Carbon Emissions Data to Customers**

We plan to offer carbon emissions data to customers based on cloud simulations to enable customers to manage emissions effectively on their own through an Open API aligned with the customer's ESG system.

·Simulate carbon emissions for selected product and offer data on reduction compared to on-premise

·Provide carbon emissions metrics via Open API and support use on the app and system through SCP

·Secure reliability by obtaining accreditation on emission measurement standards from a carbon emission certification agency

## **Develop and Propose Carbon Reduction Factors**

We will support our customer's ESG practices by validating and analyzing their on-premise carbon emissions and suggesting carbon reduction by transitioning to SCP.

·Offering MSP consulting services that demonstrate emission mitigation effects

·Providing carbon emission reduction contents such as appropriate cloud resources through the MSP portal and minimizing idle resources, etc.
