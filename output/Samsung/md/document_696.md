## **CTF Hacking Competition**

2023 DevHack CTF Since 2019

To provide a fun and exciting approach to security for our employees, Samsung SDS has been hosting inhouse online hacking competitions since 2019 to build security skills regarding software development while solving a series of security challenges. 165 employees participated in the event in 2023 with awards given to the top 5 contestants. After the contest is over, solutions to the challenges are revealed and feedback from participants are incorporated through post-surveys. Survey results showed high levels of employee satisfaction as they could gain deeper understanding on security threats and vulnerabilities seen from various perspectives that need to be considered in the system development process by attempting to solve the challenges and learning from the online solutions afterwards. We will continue to seek distinctive and engaging methods to apply to training and guides to support employees in experiencing the latest security techniques and strengthening secure coding technologies and capabilities.

Samsung SDS has a separate internal system for privacy protection, as well. The 'Privacy Internal Management Plan' which is the company's standards for privacy management can be viewed on this system along with essential legal information and news and contents related to personal information. An FAQ list of frequently asked questions by personnel handling personal information is shared with one-stop access to the internal personal information processing system and its inspection status.

We utilize contents to help our employees understand key reference data such as the Personal Information Protection Act and amendments in legislations or internal regulations when they occur.
