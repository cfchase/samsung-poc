## **Incentive Programs**

Based on the results of ESG inspections of suppliers, Samsung SDS supports incentive programs for suppliers demonstrating excellent ESG management. These incentives motivate participation in ESG practices and raise aware-ness about the necessity for ESG. In 2023, a total 8 suppliers were recognized as Excellent ESG Suppliers, receiving practical incentives for a sustainable future such as exemptions from on-site inspections in the following year, support for suppliers' education expenses, and financial support through the Win-Win Management Fund.
