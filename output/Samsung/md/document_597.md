In order to assess the climate opportunities for Samsung SDS and embed them in the business strategy, we defined low-carbon solutions that can contribute to lowering GHG emissions and adaptation. In addition, we assessed the suitability of our economic activities and calculated the net sales, CAPEX, and OPEX ratios of activities that contribute to climate change mitigation based on the EU Taxonomy standards. However, it is very difficult to quantify the short-, mid-, and long-term financial impacts of the low-carbon solutions defined by Samsung SDS and to conduct analysis of climate scenarios. This is because the data and research results required for reliable analysis have not been sufficiently accumulated, and the analysis methodology has not been established. The growth rate of low-carbon IT solutions is viewed very positively in a net-zero scenario but is not sufficient enough to be used as supporting evidence for the analysis.

For this reason, Samsung SDS will estimate and provide predictions on the potential market size and revenue fluctuations of low-carbon solutions based on market projections and mid-term revenue targets of each service that are incorporated in building business plans and further refine analysis methods.

## **Water Resource Management**

## **Water Resource Management System**

Samsung SDS recognizes the management of water resources as a key activity needed to create a sustainable future. We are committed to contributing to environmental protection through water conservation and minimizing environmental consequences by taking appropriate measures to treat used water.

## **Water Resources Management Policies**

We review the increase and decrease of water usage at all of our business sites, checking on the cause of such changes, and building mitigation measures to continuously manage quality and volume and ensure clean and stable water supply.

## **Water Consumption Reduction**

Samsung SDS adopts water reduction systems starting from the designing stages of its domestic and global business sites to manage water usage effectively. We apply water-reducing designs and technologies for data centers to carry out optimal water resource management. The Sangam Data Center leverages local chilled water (12°C) which is excellent for cooling as it is around 5°C lower than general water temperatures while having less dissipation, there -by contributing to water conservation. The free cooling method used at Sangam also helps our efforts in reducing water usage.

| Consumption | | Tonnes | 323,461 | 469,111 | 532,649 | 482,041 |

## **Water Consumption and Treatment**

Most of the water used by Samsung SDS is domestic water which is discharged to public sewage treatment plants after simple screening at business sites. We closely monitor the entire process to ensure safe disposal, especially as coolants and antifreeze liquids used at our data centers for equipment maintenance (chillers, boiler cleaning, etc.) are water pollutants and handled through professional vendors for designated waste.
