Based on technical knowhow, Samsung SDS is working hard to continuously lower carbon emissions. We are making efforts especially at our data centers to achieve low-power, high-efficiency operations by discovering and applying new technologies.

## **Performance and Next Steps**

As part of our carbon mitigation efforts, we replaced outdated equipment at the Suwon DC in 2023. We introduced high-efficiency UPS equipment which improved energy efficiency by more than 10% (85.4 â†’ 95.9%) and cut energy usage by adopting inverters for engine power equipment.

## **Minimize UPS**

Installing UPS to power supply on one side can minimize power loss during blackouts an allow switching between power supplies

In addition, simulations were made on cooling methods to compare power usage effectiveness (PUE), and on the immersion cooling system to test its performance and build a database.

Immersion cooling proof of concept (PoC) was carried out for its introduction to data centers in 2024 which is expected to serve as the basis for us developing technology requirements and operation standards.

Beginning in 2026, we will conduct phased implementation of the system, using immersion cooling to significantly lower power consumption and mitigate carbon emissions by an annual 1,298 tCO$_{2}$eq/MW. Moreover, we expect to save KRW 400 million/MW in annual operating costs compared to conventional cooling.

Continuing to expand adoption of new technologies for low-power and high-efficiency data center operations, we will deliver ESG values to customers through an eco-cloud in the long-term.

## **Immersive Liquid Cooling**

A next-generation cooling solution to efficiently cool heated IT equipment where IT equipment are immersed in a special electrically non-conductive fluid to cool down without requiring an additional cooling device
