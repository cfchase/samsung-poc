Moreover, we are devoted to protecting the data and information of everyone related to the company including our customers. With generative AI triggering unprecedented change across society, there is growing need for ethical principles and guidelines to be applied our AI-based services. Therefore, we plan to establish a digital governance system that includes policies and technical solutions for offering responsible and fair IT services that embrace AI ethics and privacy protection.

The ESG paradigm in business is now going beyond the establishment of systems and plans to actual practice and performance creation. Transparency in ESG data is becoming increasingly important as regulations on mandatory ESG reporting are announced around the world including in Korea, the U.S., and Europe. Samsung SDS will concentrate on practical efforts to bring about substantial results and manage information systematically through an ESG data platform to provide information transparently to our stakeholders.

We look forward to your ongoing interest and support towards our journey towards a sustainable future.
