## **ESG for Suppliers**

## **Supply Chain ESG**

## **ESG Training and Reinforcement of Supplier ESG Competencies**

In line with global standards such as recent demands from the EU supply chain audit requirements and ESG reporting criteria, Samsung SDS plans and operates ESG training programs for suppliers aligned with ESG policies to effectively respond to changes in the ESG management environment.

Through surveys conducted prior to training, we listen to supplier questions submitted anonymously to reflect them in training programs. In addition, guidebooks on Samsung SDS ESG policies are made each year with a detailed guide that incorporates key improvement areas for 2023, that is also shared with suppliers. Consulting to strengthen ESG competencies was also carried out for 20 Korean SMEs in partnership with KODATA, a leading corporate credit bureau in Korea.

Through such competency reinforcement programs, average scores of on-site inspections have continuously improved over the past 3 years.
