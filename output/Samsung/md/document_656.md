## **Process for Responding to Personal Data Leaks**

In accordance with the Personal Information Protection Act, Samsung SDS is equipped with a system to respond promptly to personal data leaks. Based on our process for responding to personal data leaks, the situation is identified and countermeasures are built immediately after becoming aware of the data leak. In addition, in case of such incidents, the severity of the matter is identified and disciplinary actions (up to dismissal) are taken against the violator and accountable party based on compliance standards.
