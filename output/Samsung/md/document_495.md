## **CPMS(Compliance Program Management System)**

To support employees' continuous compliance activities, we have established and operated a compliance management platform called CPMS. CPMS provides various information such as an operating system, guidelines, latest trends, and FAQs related to compliance management, allowing employees to become familiar with compliance requirements. It also offers real-time inquiry and response, self-inspection, and reporting functions. Notably, it operates a 'My Compliance Index' system that indicates the level of compliance activity based on system-based compliance activities, thereby continuously spreading a compliance culture.

## **Law Bot**

Samsung SDS operates a chatbot to enable employees to access compliance guidelines regarding their work anywhere, anytime. It is being actively used for various employee compliance activities including viewing personal CPMS indexes, accessing compliance guides, taking self-checks, signing compliance pledges, participating in training, and learning about legal violations and sanction cases. A feedback feature (to make inquiries) has also been newly added, so employees can receive answers to their questions in real-time.

## **Compliance Violation Reporting Channel**

Multiple internal and external reporting channels such as our website, the CPMS platform, and hotlines are being operated to allow compliance violations to be reported at any time.
