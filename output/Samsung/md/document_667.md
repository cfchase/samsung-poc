## **Corporate Governance**

## **Board Committees**

## **Committee Operations**

The BOD has a total 6 committees as stipulated in Article 34 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 14 of the BOD Regulations and delegates the authority of the BOD to ensure quick and efficient decision-making. The BOD enacts and stipulates regulations for committee operations through BOD resolution, detailing the organization, operations, and authority of each committee. Committee resolutions are notified to all directors within 2 business days, and each notified director may request a BOD meeting to the BOD chair within 3 business days from the date of notification, when deemed necessary. In this case, the BOD may adjudicate the resolutions made by the committee. However, resolutions made by the Audit Committee are excluded from such adjudication to guarantee independence of the audit body. Moreover, the Independent Director Recommendation Committee and Related Party Transactions Committee which each previously included one executive director, improved its independence and are composed only of independent directors starting in 2024.
