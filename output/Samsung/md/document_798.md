We have been operating a flexible working hours system since 2011, giving employees autonomy in deciding when to come and leave work to create a free and creative organizational culture. In addition, optional workhour systems were introduced in 2018 to allow flexibility in working hours to contributing to improving work efficiency and increasing work satisfaction.

## **Flexible Working Environment**

Samsung SDS supports a flexible working environment for employees to work efficiently at the time and place of their choice. When necessary, employees can work outside the office at adaptive working zones or from home using the Brity Works collaboration solution that includes messenger, meeting, and storage drive features for an efficient and seamless mobile working environment.

## **Internal Hires**

We operate an internal hire program to offer employees career development opportunities where employees can transfer to desired functions, as well as secure internal talent needed to carry out the company's strategic businesses. Internal hires are operated at least twice a year through blind screening to ensure fairness, selecting successful applicants based on their overall technical skills and work experience. In addition, functional training and mentoring is provided to create a soft-landing.
