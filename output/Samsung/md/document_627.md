We conduct accident prevention such as special safety inspections during the holidays and preparing against storm and flood damages to identify and remove risks related to emergency situations beforehand. In addition, special safety inspections led by management such as the CSO and heads of each business unit are executed to raise interest in safety and health across the company.

## **Risk Assessment**

We implement a risk assessment process where we identify hazardous and risk factors at business sites and estimate likelihood (frequency) and materiality (intensity) to build and execute risk mitigation measures.

## **Activities to Strengthen Risk Assessments**

Samsung SDS conducts regular training on risk assessment for employees and suppliers at domestic business sites, logistics centers, and construction projects, etc. We are introducing various methods to reinforce safety and health management such as operating a taskforce to verify risk assessments and receiving training and consulting through external institutions. Moreover, we gained reliability as 15 suppliers of high-risk business sites passed inspections of the Korea Occupational Safety and Health Agency.

## **Right to Cease Work**

Samsung SDS guarantees all workers including subcontractors the right to cease work and evacuate when the worker finds it necessary in case of imminent danger of an occupational hazard. We are working hard for safety management at business sites by promoting the right to cease work by actively communicating that there are no disadvantages for exercising this right and that incentives may be given when contribution to disaster prevention are acknowledged.
