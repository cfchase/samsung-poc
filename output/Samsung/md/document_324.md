## **Cloud Security**

In response to the rapidly evolving business environment, Samsung SDS has established an optimized cloud work environment based on the Samsung Cloud Platform (SCP) to secure new competitiveness through cloudbased digital transformation. Acting as a cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud management service provider (MSP), we conduct various activities to ensure a robust cloud security system. Samsung SDS prioritizes the introduction of an SCP-based Identity Access Management (IAM) solution, or Single ID, the development of various Software as a Service (SaaS)-type endpoint security solutions, and the automation of malware detection and security measures leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. Owing to these efforts, Samsung SDS' cloud security capabilities have gained international recognition, receiving accolades such as the Security Company of the Year from Frost & Sullivan for three consecutive years (2020-2022). In 2022, we were recognized as a major player in the worldwide cloud security services market by IDC, as reported in their IDC MarketScape Cloud Security Services Report.

## **Cloud Security Inspections**

With the increase in cloud environments, Samsung SDS has developed new security guides for each type of cloud and shared it with employees to provide standards for building and using safe cloud environments. In addition, we prepared a separate checklist for the cloud environment and are expanding inspection targets and automatic inspections to strengthen management of a safe cloud environment. Inspection scopes were expanded in 2023 to include a total 25 public cloud services used by 3 of our subsidiaries in inspections and identified 172 vulnerabilities. Immediate action was taken on 109 substantial items and are taking continuous measures and improvements on other items with weak security management for ongoing improvement and management of the cloud security environment.
