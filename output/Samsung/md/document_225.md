## **Analysis of Financial Impact from Transition Risk**

Samsung SDS categorizes transition risks into policy/legal, technical, market, and reputational risks and quantifies the anticipated financial impact from a mid-to-long-term perspective. In particular, in the case of policy risks, we conducted a scenario analysis using S&P Global's methodology to increase the reliability of the analysis. First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2Â°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts. Market risks were calculated by assessing the cost of switching to renewable energy in the power sector through analysis of the supply price of renewable energy, while reputational risks were analyzed based on the financial impact on revenues resulting from increased negative stakeholder feedback due to inadequate climate-related disclosure and greenwashing.
