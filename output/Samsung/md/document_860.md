Pursuant to the Act on the Collection and Use of Donations, external sponsorships are considered substantial, regardless of their form, with execution of funds being managed transparently through verification from review councils based on the size of the sponsorship. In addition, preliminary reviews are carried out to ensure funds are used appropriately in line with the actual purpose of the sponsorship.
