## **Survey on Recognizing Change in the Organizational Culture(CCT)**

In 2023, a field-led activity titled CCT (Change our Culture Together) was carried out to improve our organizational culture. Through biannual surveys on our corporate culture, inefficiencies and unreasonable practices in work were identified and opinion were gathered on how to enhance mutual respect and improve department culture such as in the way work is done. Following the survey, department leaders and members implemented improvement measures tailored to the situation of their respective departments. When additional improvement was needed, weak points were identified and consulting to propose customized solutions were also offered.

Change Agents contribute to building dynamic departments by listening to and sharing the opinions of members, boosting communication, and complementing weaknesses through various activities fit for the department's characteristics and unique situation.
