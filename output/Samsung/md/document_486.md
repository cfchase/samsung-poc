Samsung SDS frequently monitors risks associated with the role of each BOD committee and builds a risk management strategy to respond accordingly. In addition, the CFO is designated as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and holds a Risk Management Council where relevant departments participate to share identified risks and devise countermeasures. The Risk Management Council manages and develops policies to address all types of risks including financial risks such as market, credit, and liquidity risks, as well as operational risks such as compliance, human rights, safety, and environmental risks, operating relevant programs through each responsible department.

The Risk Management Council manages risks through impact analysis of risks with potential losses and by implementing appropriate responses while reporting material risks to the BOD and its committees to reflect it in the business strategy. In addition, relevant departments manage financial and non-financial risks across all business stages. In particular, we have a system in place for emerging risks in technology and services to be shared immediately with the dedicated organization and relevant departments to respond promptly.
