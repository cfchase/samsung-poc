Samsung SDS is setting an example in energy conservation at business sites by turning off indoor lighting an hour earlier (21:00 â†’ 20:00) and carrying out campaigns to turn off computers and monitors. On the 2023 Earth Day in April, we also participated in the nationwide Earth Hour event to raise employee awareness on energy conservation. Samsung SDS is taking the lead in ESG management through such actions, encouraging employees to take time off and also striving to reduce light pollution at the same time.

## **Green Walking Challenge**

On the occasion of Samsung SDS' 38 th anniversary, the 'Green Walking Challenge' was held in April 2023 where employees donated trees based on the number of steps they took. A total 3,129 employees took part in the challenge, taking a total 430,070,000 steps and donating around 300 trees to the Forest for Life NGO to contribute to curbing GHG emissions.
