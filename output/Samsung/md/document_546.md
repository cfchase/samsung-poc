## **Limitations and approach used to mitigate limitations**

The Assurer performed limited verification for a limited period based on the data provided by the reporting organization. It implies that no significant errors were found during the verification process, and that there are limitations related to the inevitable risks that may exist. The Assurer does not provide assurance for possible future impacts that cannot be predicted or verified during the verification process and any additional aspects related thereto.

## **Competency and Independence**

BSI (British Standards Institution) is a leading global standards and assessment body founded in 1901. BSI is an independent professional institution that specializes in quality, health, safety, social and environmental management with almost 120 years history in providing independent assurance services globally.
