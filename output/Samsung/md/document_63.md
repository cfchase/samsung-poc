Samsung SDS focuses on fostering professional AI and Cloud specialists by offering tiered training and programs for specific functions through the company's talent cultivation system that was built to sharpen business competitiveness in these areas. Starting with basic online training for all employees, we also provide proprietary programs developed inhouse and programs tailored to each vendor to strengthen professional capabilities.

## **Software Development Support System**

Samsung SDS operates step-by-step training and a software competency test for employees to sharpen software competitiveness and build software algorithm and programming capabilities. When employees obtain top levels in the program, they can acquire additional points for promotions, as well as incentive benefits. In addition, new courses were added to cultivate software architects and core reviewers to create a development culture based on software and continuously strengthen our software competencies.

## **Leadership Training**

We continue to carry out Leadership Training to new leaders to help them understand their leadership roles and strengthen the fundamentals needed to manage an organization. In addition, we send Leadership Letters to our executives and department heads to share analysis and solutions for actual issues faced by fellow leaders to reinforce organizational management and leadership skills.
