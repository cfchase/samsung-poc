The labor-management council sets up a Grievance Handling Committee and Office to address grievances, both big and small, faced by employees in a quick and fair manner. Employees can file complaints through the council's main portal while the details and reporter of the filed complaint are kept strictly confidential throughout the investigation and interviewing process to provide appropriate replies.

## **Samsung Culture Index (SCI)**

Each year, Samsung SDS conducts the Samsung Culture Index (SCI) survey to all employees based on 30 questions across the 3 categories of enjoyable work, companionship with colleagues, and pride in company to identify strengths and weaknesses in the organizational culture and draw out improvement measures. Along with the survey, focus group interviews are held with employees to understand their emotional state. The survey results were used to set the direction for making improvements, as well as planning and operating follow-up measures in order to create a healthy organizational culture.
