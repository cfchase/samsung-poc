Samsung SDS implements the domestic safety and health management system, as well as a wide range of activities to secure safety and health for employees at overseas business sites. We designate dedicated staff for safety and health to report incidents and work with an information-sharing system and conduct bimonthly meetings to communicate effectively with headquarters to improve the overall safety and health management level at our overseas operations.

## **Safety & Health Management System Certification (ISO 45001)**

Since obtaining the first certification for our safety and health management system in 2014, we have maintained certification through continuous renewal each year including completion of transition from OHSAS 18001 to the international standard ISO 45001 in 2017. In 2020, the certification scope was extended from headquarters and overseas subsidiaries to include overseas logistics zones and hubs, as well. Samsung SDS boasts a system that identifies and assesses risks associated with business activities in order to minimizes its impact.

## **Internal and External Safety & Health Assessment System**

We work with the Samsung Institute of EHS Strategy and external institutions such as labor attorneys and law firms for diagnosis and consulting to draw out and act on areas to improve in our Safety & Health Management System. In addition, after self-inspections are completed by each business unit, assessments and improvement activities are carried out in for safety and health through the EHS Center's diagnosis process.
