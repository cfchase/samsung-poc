## **Smart Work Culture**

Samsung SDS carries out various activities to foster an efficient work culture and help employees strike a work-life balance. First, we are conducting a Smart Work Campaign, distributing a guide on how to write reports, hold meetings, and practice phone etiquettes during meetings and encouraging employee participation. We also notify employees on recommended annual leaves to ensure they get sufficient rest to balance their professional and personal lives. Various events such as contests for best vacation plans, introduction to famous restaurants at popular travel destinations, or contests for best vacation photo, etc. are held to create an atmosphere where employees are encouraged to take leaves.

## **Communication between Employees and Management**

## **CEO Code Time (Online Communication Program)**

We operate CEO Code Time, a program for the CEO, business division leaders, and employees to share current business conditions, news on the latest technologies, and business strategy under the idea of all employees uniting under the same Samsung SDS code. Four live online sessions were held in 2023 that also included a Q&A session where employees were able to receive answers to their questions on internal issues.
