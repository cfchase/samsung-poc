## **Legal Risk Assessment and Monitoring**

Samsung SDS carries out legal risk assessments and monitoring activities for key management areas to identify compliance risks and make improvements across all business sites. Legal risk assessments focus on unveiling risks related to anti-corruption and fair trade and classifies the risks through site interviews and risk assessments to build and enforce risk control measures for the potential risks. In addition, we conduct legal risk inspection activities to discern improvements in risk factors associated with the Subcontracting Act, Mutually Beneficial Cooperation Act, and Protection of Dispatched Workers Act considering the nature of our business where cooperating with suppliers is essential. Afterwards, follow-up measures are taken such as training, promotional activities, offering guidelines, and process improvements, etc.
