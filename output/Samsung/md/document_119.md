## **Communicating with Investors**

Samsung SDS actively communicates with shareholders and investors through various types of IR activities. In addition to common investor relations meetings, we also carry out non-deal roadshows (NDRs) and participate in IR conferences hosted by securities firms. We also offer live webcasts of our quarterly earnings conference calls to enhance accessibility for general investors.

External events held in 2023 included the Cloud Media Day in March and REAL Summit in September where Samsung SDS presented its core cloud and generative AI businesses to investors, as well as overseas IR sessions where management met with investors in Hong Kong and Singapore.

## **Protection of Shareholder Interests**

Samsung SDS operates e-voting systems and live online broadcasts of our shareholder meetings to enhance convenience for our shareholders. In addition, agenda and reference material for the share holder meeting are provided to shareholders 4 weeks prior to the meeting to give them sufficient time for review.
