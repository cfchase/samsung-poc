Data Centers use cooling towers to effectively remove the heat generated from large capacity chillers. Previous closed-type chillers isolate cooling liquids from the atmosphere and has an advantage in terms of being less affected by external contamination. However, such closed-type cooling towers use brines (EG solutions) to prevent freezing in the winter which requires a separate process for discharging or disposal to prevent environmental pollution, as well as an additional feed water pump that results in more energy consumption than open-type cooling towers. The Suwon Data Center replaced its closed-type cooling towers with high-efficiency open-types that can be controlled based on cooling loads and reduced around 952 tons of GHG emissions.

## **Temperature and Humidity Chambers**

Most of the electrical energy used by IT equipment in computing is emitted as heat energy which is why large capacity cooling facilities are essential at data centers. The temperature and humidity chamber supplies cool air inside server rooms, but previous models with fixed-speed fans could not be controlled based on cooling loads and had heavy energy consumption. Replacing these outdated models with temperature-based control high-efficiency models, the Suwon Data Center reduced around 1,494 tons of GHG emissions.
