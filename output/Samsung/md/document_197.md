Accordingly, we set 'Social Value Creation' as the strategic direction of our social efforts and selected strengthening DEI to respect and embrace our diverse workforce and expanding and advancing safety and health management for our global employees and supply chains as our strategic social initiatives. In addition, we applied the supply chain ESG management system used at headquarters to our subsidiaries and overseas subsidiaries and identified building a digital responsibility management system was selected as a strategic initiative to manage the risks associated with the latest IT technologies. This way, we aim to respond to the needs of various stakeholders and create social value.
