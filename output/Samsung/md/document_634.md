Inspections are carried out over two rounds of audits where on-site improvements that can be made through immediate corrections were made during the 1 st audit, and improvements that require mid-to-long-term initiatives were checked during the 2 nd audit.

Four suppliers with the high scores in the 2 nd audit were given Supplier with ESG Excellence Certification plaques while 10 suppliers that exceeded an improvement rate thresholds were given Certificates of ESG Management Supplier to motivate suppliers and recognize their efforts in enhancing ESG management.
