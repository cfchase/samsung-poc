Samsung SDS joined hands with the World Vision NGO to provide meals to disadvantaged youth being raised by single parents, grandparents, or low-income families living in Songpa-gu who face challenges in accessing adequate nutrition. High-quality home-cooked meals tailored to the nutritional needs and preferences of adolescents are provided to support healthy growth and adjustments to school life. Teachers monitor the students to offer emotional support and stability, as well, and to intervene early on in case of a crisis. In 2023, 50 students across 4 middle schools were sponsored through the program.

## **Holiday Market to Boost Rural Economies**

Each year, Samsung SDS operates an online market during the lunar new year and Chusok holiday seasons to expand markets for farmers and small businesses and help promote local economies. Thanks to voluntary participation from employees, around KRW 82 million worth of agricultural goods were sold during the holiday seasons in 2023, contributing to local economies. In addition, donations of rice cakes and rice were made to the disadvantaged living in Songpa-gu, Seoul in wishes of happy and warm holidays.

## **Laptop Donations**

Since 1995, Samsung SDS has been refurbishing idle laptops to donate to educational institutions at home and abroad through NGOs to bridge the digital divided among underprivileged youth and contribute to the circular economy. In 2023, we donated a total 360 idle laptops to regional children's centers, youth detention centers, and welfare centers in the Philippines, Myanmar, and Tanzania which brought the cumulative number of laptops recycled for narrowing the digital divide and improving information accessibility to 5,047.
