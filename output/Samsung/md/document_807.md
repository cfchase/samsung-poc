Samsung SDS builds and implements a safety & health policy for the safety and health of stakeholders including employees, suppliers, customers, and communities. Occupational Safety & Health Committees are set up at major business sites for management and employee representatives to meet on a quarterly basis to discuss important matters related to safety and health at the workplace, as well as develop and decide on implementation plans.

Through this policy, we will continue to refine the safety and health management system not only for our employees and suppliers, but also for all stakeholders of areas managed by Samsung SDS.

## **Safety & Health Implementation Plan**

For effective execution of the safety & health policy, Samsung SDS sets key targets and implementation plans which are submitted to the BOD for approval.
