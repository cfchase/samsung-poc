Pursuant to the Software Promotion Act, software process (SP) certifications are granted through comprehensive assessment by the National IT Industry Promotion Agency (NIPA) on the software process quality capabilities of software companies. Samsung SDS is the only Korean company to have obtained the highest certification grade since the certification program was launched in 2009. High quality software processes imply that the entire software development process is consistent from beginning to end and is being continuously improved to offer better services. The granted SP certification grade is the result of assessment of project activities executed by the given company with Grade 2 meaning project management, development, and support areas meet industry standards. Grade 3, however, requires organization management and process improvements to be carried out, as well. Grade 2 assessments review project management (planning, control, and supplier management), development (specification management, analysis, design, deployment, and testing), and support (quality assurance, configuration management, measurement and analysis), and Grade 3 assessments include organization management (organization process management, member training) and process improvements (organizational performance management, problem-solving, process improvement management). Samsung SDS is committed to further enhancing quality capabilities grounded on processes, methodologies, and systems to earn trust from customers.
