In line with the ESG business trend, many companies are driving digital transformations to go paperless. Samsung SDS is also conducting a 'Go Paperless, Go Digital, Go Green' campaign, highlighting a paperless office and encouraging employees to reduce use of paper documents.

## **RE:CYCLE**

Samsung SDS is conducting a RE:CYCLE campaign to collect and recycle used coffee capsules within the company. Building a consensus among employees on the need to recycle coffee capsules that were being thrown away as general waste, we partnered with NESPRESSO to start this campaign in November 2023. Since the start of the campaign, over 50,000 capsules have been retrieved and recycled, contributing to the reduction of approximately 190kgCO$_{2}$eq of GHG emissions. This is equivalent to the amount of carbon dioxide annually absorbed by 22 pine trees surviving for 30 years.

In addition, we are also carrying out a campaign to collect waste mobile phones and have separate collection bins for waste batteries to encourage employees to easily take part in eco-friendly activities. Samsung SDS is dedicated to improving employee awareness on the circular economy through various recycling programs.

## **Use of Eco-friendly Paper**

The agenda handbook for the 39 th General Shareholders' Meeting was made using FSC-certified paper, and envelopes used internally at the company are being switched to low carbon paper products.
