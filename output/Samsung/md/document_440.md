The standard DevSecOps system of Samsung SDS based on DevOps principles categorizes development operation lifecycles into the 7 areas of Plan, Development, Validate, Deploy, Monitor & Operation, Collaboration, and Security. Security is embedded into the standardized toolchains of each area and visualizes the entire progress flow for measurement.
