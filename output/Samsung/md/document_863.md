## **Information Security Policies**

Samsung SDS establishes information security policies to define and protect all information assets held by the company. We define information security regulations that reflect the top management's determination and security direction that must be observed along with 11 information security guidelines that define specific principles and duties that must be carried out. In addition, technical details or more elaborate guides are prepared separately for distribution, when needed, such as the 'Cloud Security Management Guide' and the 'Project Security Guide.'
