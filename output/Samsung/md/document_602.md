Samsung SDS is committed to upholding human rights by creating an inclusive working environment for its members and actively responding to demands from the international community to take part in human rights protection activities. To this end, we support and observe the principles of human rights suggested by international organizations and groups including the UN Declaration of Human Rights, the ILO's (International Labor Organization) Core Con -ventions, the RBA (Responsible Business Alliance) Code of Conduct, and local labor laws of the regions in which we do business. In addition, the DEI Secretariat was established in December 2023, launching a new global organization that designates DEI officers at our headquarters and overseas subsidiaries to strengthen our internal human rights management system.
