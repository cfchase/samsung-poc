## **Customer Satisfaction Index (CSI)**

Samsung SDS has been working with Gallup Korea since 2008 in conducting annual customer satisfaction surveys by customer sector, group, and business type. The survey is carried out to all customers that have interacted with Samsung SDS in the customer experience stage with questions customized to the role (deployer and contractor, operator, actual user, internal employee) of each customer considering the nature of the service and solutions business.

In 2023, the survey base was expanded and switched to using random sampling to gather real voice of customers (VoC) to reflect in our products. As a result, overall satisfaction was rated at 84.4, and relevant organizations were able to build and implement improvement initiatives based on the quality measurements from each customer journey.
