## **UPS (Uninterruptible Power Supply)**

IT equipment at data centers use uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) for stable power supply as they can be easily affected by fluctuations in voltage and frequencies, instantaneous interruptions, and voltage surges. The system requires conversions between AC and DC to switch between charging and discharging as UPS receives power supply from batteries in the event of power outages or voltage drops. The Suwon Data Center replaced its outdated UPS system with a modular high-efficiency UPS and old lead acid batteries with high-durability lithium-ion batteries to minimize the massive amount of electrical energy being lost in the form of heat energy during the conversion. Introduction of the high-efficiency UPS was found to have improved overall performance by around 10%, reducing approximately 565 tons of GHG emissions.

## **Transformers**

While extra high-voltage power is supplied to data centers to support their massive use of energy, transformers are needed to step down the voltages and make necessary adjustments to be used by IT equipment and other facilities. The Suwon Data Center used oil-filled transformers with insulating oil that serve as insulators and coolants but switched to mold transformers that use epoxy resin for insulation and cooling. Mold transformers are space efficient, allowing for high-efficiency designs within same volume areas. The replacement resulted in 304 tons of GHG emission reductions.
