We are also doing our utmost to fight corruption in the organization by conducting anti-corruption education to management at our overseas subsidiaries in 2024. Samsung SDS will continue to implement various programs not only to reinforce business ethics and compliance, but also to take the lead in eradicating corruption by taking into account internal and external situations and acquiring external accreditation.

## **Reinforce Information Security Risk Management**

As a member of the IT sector, Samsung SDS is devoted to information security risk management. Under systematic governance, we have information security policies in place to define and protect all of the company's information assets and have appointed a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) to oversee and supervise all relevant activities. In addition, we have built a strong system that consists of a security incident prevention and response process to raise security awareness, internalize security practices, and minimize relevant risks.

## **Performance and Next Steps**

We are thoroughly managing information security risks through systematic governance and processes. We are also working hard to prevent information leaks by implementing various policies and activities such as operating a personal information management system, security checks, and security monitoring.

In addition, we made improvements to the 'Privacy Protection' section on our website and promoted it to external stakeholders to enhance their trust in our risk management regarding personal information protection.

In 2024, an 'Information Security' page was added to our website to reinforce communication and data disclosures through which we will continue to provide information accurately and promptly.

We will continue to update our information security contents through various channels and promote our information security risk management efforts to further strengthen trust from our key stakeholders.
