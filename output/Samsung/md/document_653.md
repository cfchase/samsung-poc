We recognize that AI technologies should aspire to human dignity and human rights, as well as to the environment and ecosystem. Therefore, Samsung SDS established corporate AI ethics principles based on the UNESCO ethical guidelines on artificial intelligence and applies it to all AI technology developments and usage.

We appointed a Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to proactively respond to privacy issues and personal information protection. We prepared management regulations in accordance with the Personal Information Protection Act, inspecting implementation of personal information protection policies each year and operating a Personal Data Protection Council. Our employees are fully aware of the importance of data privacy and are using and protecting personal data based on relevant policies and regulations.

We are working towards open source compliance and contributing to an open source ecosystem.

Based on our core values of sharing and collaboration, we are pursuing various activities to promote shared growth of the open source community and developers. Samsung SDS also implements open source policies in order to guarantee the appropriate usage of open source software and autonomous compliance. This prevents legal risks and violation of exclusive rights that may arise from indiscreet usage or distribution of open source licenses to contribute to value creation by utilizing open source.
