To protect pregnant employees from the risk of miscarriages or premature births, Samsung SDS provides the option of reduced working hours and systematically guarantees time for prenatal check-ups. Also, when it is tough for employees to work full-time due to childcare after giving birth, there is option to work shorter hours instead of taking full-day parental leaves to ease the burden of childcare responsibilities.

## **Pre-/Post-Childbirth Leaves and Miscarriage Leaves**

We offer leaves before and after childbirth and in the event of miscarriages to ensure pregnant employees have sufficient time to rest around the time of their due dates and take care of their newborns after giving birth. Employees can also take 15 days (20 days in case of multiple births) when their spouse give birth to help with housework and actively engage in parenting.

## **Best Family-friendly Management Certification**

Samsung SDS first received Best Family-friendly Management certification in February and renewed it in December 2021, maintaining the status for 11 years as of 2024.

## **Talent Profile and Recruiting Process**

Samsung SDS does not discriminate against the educational, gender, nationality, or religious backgrounds of candidates to recruit responsible individuals with integrity who take on the future with relentless passion to transform the world through creativity and innovation. We operate a fair and transparent recruiting process that gives everyone seeking employment an equal opportunity to secure excellent talent across various areas. New joiners are recruited through open recruitment twice a year, once in the first half and the other in the second half, while seasoned employees are recruited based on need of each function or business division. Starting in 2023, we have resumed open recruitment for internships to select outstanding new talent and offer interns the opportunity to take part in field practice.
