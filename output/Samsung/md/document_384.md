Key Performance

Adoption of the Senior Independent Director System

Building a transparent and credible governance system is the force that drives ESG management. That's why Samsung SDS set 'Transparent Management' as the company's strategic direction in the area of governance. In order to strengthen the actual authority and roles of the Board of Directors, we are working towards enhancing the independence of the Board and establishing advanced global mechanisms to strengthen shareholder protection. In addition, we comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations which are being globally reinforced, as well as thoroughly mange economic/social losses and external risks that may arise from unethical business practices. We are also focusing various efforts to fulfill our role as a responsible IT company by building an information security risk management system to sharpen competitiveness and secure reliability in information security and create an internal security culture through active communication on such efforts.

## **Enhance BOD Independence**

Samsung SDS has put in place various mechanisms to enable the BOD to function independently of management and controlling shareholders. We strive to ensure the BOD maintains independence to carry out its role of supervising and keeping management decisions in check.

## **Performance and Next Steps**

In order to enhance BOD independence, we introduced the senior independent director system in October 2023. This system allows for appropriate balance and checks by appointing a senior independent director to represent independent directors when the CEO or an executive director serves as BOD Chair, and Hyun-Han Shin was selected as our first senior independent director. The senior independent director can arrange and convene meetings among the independent directors and supports communication between outside directors and the BOD Chair and members of management. Furthermore, composition of the Independent Director Recommendation Committee was changed to all outside directors in 2024 to advance the independent director screening process. Samsung SDS will faithfully operate the advanced Independent Director Recommendation Committee and continue to identify new measures for strengthening BOD indepdnence.
