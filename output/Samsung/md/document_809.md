The EHS Committee meets quarterly to share key safety and health activities with management including with the CSO. Other regular activities such as the Occupational Safety & Health Committee, the Safety & Health Council, and risk assessments are carried out to listen to voices of all employees including those of our suppliers. In addition, various channels such as chatbots, the EHS portal, SSMS (Smart Safety Management System), and a dedicated hotline (02-6155-1119) are being operated to listen to opinions on risk factors and make necessary improvements.
