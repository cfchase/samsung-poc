## **Analysis on Financial Impact of Physical Risks**

Samsung SDS has been using S&P Global's Climanomics framework since 2022 to identify and analyze financial impact of physical risks associated with the company's key assets. The scope of the analysis includes 30 assets including global data centers (owned and leased) and the headquarter and subsidiary offices. In line with the RCP scenario in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, annual average asset value loss rates and loss values were measured for the shortterm (2024), mid-term (2025~2029), and long-term (2030~2050), and each asset's exposure to 8 climate risks including urban flooding and extreme temperatures were identified.

Through the analysis, loss rates for assets under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has the highest climate risks, was forecast at 4.9% in 2030 and 7.3% in 2050. These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.

## **Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario**

Managing the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.

Of the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.
