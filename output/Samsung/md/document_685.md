## **Security Verification**

Samsung SDS established a software security verification system with specialized verification procedures for each stage to minimize security vulnerabilities in system and product developments and ensure safe software development. Verification is carried out across the entire process from security design to source code, open source, application systems and infrastructure, to services, prior to launch or before services are opened, allowing transfer to operations only when passing verification standards.
