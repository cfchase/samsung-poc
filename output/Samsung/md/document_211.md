## **Climate Action**

## **GHG Emissions Management**

Samsung SDS manages greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for each business site by classifying them into three scopes. As IT and logistics services are the key business areas of Samsung SDS, power consumption for operating domestic and global data centers account for the largest amount of our emissions while Scope 3 emissions from our global logistics services are also relatively high. GHG emissions at Samsung SDS are projected to continue to increase as our business grows which can trigger a severe climate risk. Acknowledging the importance of the environment, Samsung SDS implements and operates data centers equipped with the latest energy mitigation technologies to reduce this climate risk. Moreover, we plan to make a 100% transition to renewable energy by expanding solar power generation facilities and making REC purchases. In particular, we are disclosing not only emissions for domestic upstream transportation, but also our Scope 3 emissions that include global transportation to taken a preemptive response across the entire value chain as supply chain management including Scope 3 emissions becomes more important than before.

## **Scope 1, 2 GHG Emissions**
