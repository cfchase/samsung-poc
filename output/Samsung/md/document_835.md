Samsung SDS carries out activities on a regular basis to prevent service and system failures and conducts annual mock drills for failure and disaster recovery. In addition, we monitor our infrastructure equipment and applications 24/7, sharing anomalies in real-time with relevant departments to ensure measures are taken in a timely manner. Through the FRB, or Failure Review Board where RCA (Root Cause Analysis) experts participate, we review the technical cause, operating environment, measures and preventive measures involved, etc. to and cascades it across the entire company to prevent recurrence.
