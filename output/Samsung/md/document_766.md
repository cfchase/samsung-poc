Samsung SDS is carrying out a phased implementation of replacing its entire business vehicles (total 156 units) 100% with zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2030. In addition, we are deploying electric vehicle (EV) charging infrastructure within the employee and visitor parking lots at our domestic business sites to make it more convenient for our employees to use EVs. A total 26 EV charging stations have been installed at the company's business sites including the Jamsil West Campus and 4 data centers(Suwon, Chuncheon, Gumi, Dongtan) with more installations scheduled in 2024 at Jamsil East Campus and Sangam Data Center.
