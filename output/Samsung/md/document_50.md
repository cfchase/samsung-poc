Regulatory and reputational risks refer to risks associated with uncertainties in regulatory changes and risk of undermined reputation due to water resource issues.

·Unimproved/No drinking water: Ratio of population that obtain drinking water from unprotected water wells, rivers, or lakes, etc.

·Unimproved/No sanitation: Ratio of population that directly dispose of human waste in non-hygiene areas or as solid waste

## **Risk Assessment Outcome**

Overall, Samsung SDS' domestic business sites were found to have a low-medium level water risk, whereas its overseas businesses sites showed high risks in China, Vietnam, and India, but relatively lower risks in the US, Europe, Singapore, and South America. However, this risk analysis is simply based on data using WRI's own tool and may differ from the actual water resource management status of our business sites.

※ Water resources used in China, Vietnam, and India are around 3,000 tonnes, accounting for less than 1% of the total

## **Waste Management**

## **Waste Management System**

Samsung SDS established a waste management system in 2023 with waste management metrics based on business site and type of waste, working hard to reduce general waste, a major source of waste, from business sites by managing the total amount of waste disposal. In 2023, we started efforts to cut down on use of disposable products not only for recycling, but also to fundamentally lower waste volume, and are actively conducting campaigns led by the corporate and business-level environmental departments based on various ideas to engage employee participation.

## **Designation of target business sites**

- All Samsung SDS' business sites

* Subject to legal management: 5 data centers (Suwon/Sangam/Dongtan/Chuncheon/Gumi), West Campus, East Campus, Seoul R&D Campus, Pangyo IT Campus, Pangyo Logistics Campus, Giheung Tera Tower

## **Scope of waste**

- Business site waste, designated waste, recyclable waste

## **Waste calculation system**

- Business site waste: Volume-based general waste bags

- Designated waste: Allbaro system data

- Recyclable waste: Scaled weight

## **Management of waste recycling, landfill, and incineration rates (ESG evaluation item)**

- Building standards for managing waste at each business site

- External advisory and verification from professional waste certifiers

## **Waste Reduction Policy (5R's)**
