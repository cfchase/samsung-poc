## **Implement a Carbon Dashboard for Logistics Services**

The carbon dashboard for customers was created to help customers understand and make use of carbon emissions information. Cello manages transport data across all routes used to calculate emissions, securing reliability in calculations by utilizing EcoTransIT. A customized dashboard is provided to each of our customers, allowing emissions in the supply chain to be monitored immediately for control to support customers in managing emissions effectively throughout the logistics process.

The dashboard gives customers complete visibility into the emissions of all transport modes in the supply chain. This includes not only international routes, but also local routes and even emissions from logistics centers. Moreover, various types of analyses are supported such as carbon emissions and intensity, monthly and annual emissions trends, and information on top emission routes. This way, customers can manage emissions more efficiently across periods, routes, and transport modes associated with high carbon emissions.

## **Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System**

We set up the Cello Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System to manage emissions systematically across the 200 logistics centers operating in 35 countries worldwide. Previously, only emissions from transportation means such as air and sea transport could be monitored, but services have been extended to logistics centers to enable customers to view emissions across the entire logistics process. Based on data such as operating periods, area utilized, and electricity usage, emission factors of each country are incorporated to calculate real-time emissions on a monthly basis.

Samsung SDS will continue to provide eco-friendly values to customers by expanding its cloud and logistics services.
