We also operate an on-site communication program where our CEO visits employees in person across the country. There are a variety of in-person programs where employees can meet the CEO and address their curiosities through face-to-face discussions. This enables leadership to listen to the views of employees from the field while also sharing tailored messages to each business site (held a total 3 times in 2023).
