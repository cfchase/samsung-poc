Samsung SDS has developed and distributed 50 self-check items based on the Code of Conduct that sets the direction for supply chain ESG to suppliers. Depending on their respective sectors, suppliers carry out annual self-inspections consisting of 45 questions. Prior to distribution, suppliers receive training on how to conduct the self-inspections, understanding the direction for supply chain ESG management, and new inspection questions while Q&A sessions are also set aside to encourage interactive communication.

## **On-site inspection**

The dedicated supply chain ESG organization, that carries out independent verification functions, is responsible for performing on-site inspections of suppliers. To rigorously scrutinize the work environment of suppliers, Samsung SDS identifies issues and formulate short- and mid-to-long-term initiatives based on feedback from suppliers. Immediate corrections are made for issues that can be improved on-site while other issues are monitored based o the supplier's improvement plans. We also provide an implementation guide along with training on each specific item to contribute to enhancing the level of ESG management of our suppliers. In particular, we are supporting suppliers with detailed guidelines to prepare them for changes in internal and external ESG focus areas such as activities to increase supplier diversity and joining the effort to respond to climate change.
