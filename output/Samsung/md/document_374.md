## **ESG Council**

The CFO-led ESG Council was established to promote interdepartmental communication for sustainable management and respond to sustainability initiatives at the working-level. The council is broken down again into separate groups for E, S, and G categories to carry out in-depth discussions for each topic and report back to the ESG Committee. The ESG Council meets once a month or as needed when relevant issues arise, playing a crucial role in responding to sustainability initiatives.
