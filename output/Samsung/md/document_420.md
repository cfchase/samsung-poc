## **Human Rights Governance**

Samsung SDS established the DEI Secretariat to ensure human rights are upheld in carrying out business and to review and support human rights management activities systematically. Labor rights are managed across multiple levels through the ESG Committee and DEI Secretariat while the People Team develops activities and policies for employee human rights programs and also supervises implementation at our business sites.

## **Channel for Handling Human Rights Grievances**

Samsung SDS operates grievance mechanisms and channels to receive reports and take measures on complaints from stakeholders including our employees, suppliers, and business partners regarding human rights issues. We strive to provide effective and acceptable remedies for human rights violations. Reports are immediately forwarded to relevant departments for investigation, and for reports on discrimination or harassment, the complainant and the accused may be separated considering the severity of the case and the complainant's opinion. The cases are sent to the Review Committee for Workplace Bullying and the Disciplinary Committee, when necessary, to prevent similar cases from reoccurring.

The same internal procedures are taken for reports made by other stakeholders such as suppliers and business partners. We check to see if measures are taken appropriately to both internal and external parties and use prevention actions and changes in business practices to ensure such cases are not repeated.

## **Safeguarding Organizational Culture**

In order to create a healthy organizational culture based on mutual respect, Samsung SDS operates a 24/7 channel where employees can report any type of action that may undermine the work atmosphere such as workplace bullying, sexual harassment, forced drinking, or verbal and physical abuse.

## **Channel for Reporting Corruption and Compliance Issues**

Samsung SDS operates a channel on its website for anonymous reports to be filed on irregularities and acts of corruption made by the company or its employees. Through this channel, we are addressing the grievances and complaints of stakeholders including our suppliers such as giving or receiving money and gifts and violations of the Fair Trade Act or Personal Information Protection Act, etc.
