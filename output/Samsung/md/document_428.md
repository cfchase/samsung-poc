Samsung SDS holds biannual campus recruiting at domestic and global graduate schools that have a strong reputation in areas that coincide with the company's key business areas of cloud computing, solutions, and logistics to recruit excellent talent with masters' and doctorate degrees. In 2023, we held various recruiting activities including recruiting consultation for labs related to our core business fields and technologies and Tech Seminars led by our executives and technology leaders. In addition, we are operating a 'Recruiting Chatbot' to make it easy for graduate school researchers to ask questions and receive recruitment counseling.

## **Special Algorithm Lecture for Undergraduates**

Since 2018, Samsung SDS has been hosting the 'Samsung SDS Special Algorithm Lecture for Undergraduates' twice a year during summer and winter break for college seniors and graduates aspiring to become IT specialists. A group of lecturers composed of our employees offer intensive coverage and practice of algorithms to help college students build algorithm and programming capabilities while also serving as a channel for discovering new talent to recruit to the company. Offline programs such as the Internal Solution Tour and Career Mentoring Program which were halted due to COVID-19 also resumed in 2023 to provide overall employment assistance to college students.
