## **Backup Management**

Samsung SDS has established and operates a detailed backup policy to prepare against data damage and service disruption caused by disasters or security incidents. As the threat of attacks on backup systems has increased recently, detailed security guides and checklists for backup systems have been prepared and distributed. Accordingly, periodic inspections are conducted for each business division to ensure that security levels such as access control and authorization management for backup system administration accounts, network configuration, and log management are being managed at a level similar to that of the operating system. In 2023, the inspection scope for backup servers was expanded from domestic business sites to backup systems of overseas subsidiaries, and the found vulnerabilities were fixed.

## **Business Continuity Plan for Systems**

We have established and operated 'Business Continuity Management' guidelines with common standards for preparing against natural disasters and security incidents that can occur despite various prevention management activities. A department dedicated to disaster and accident prevention and response has been formed, and the person in charge of each system establishes a business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems, we establish detailed processes for establishing and operating a DR center and manage implementation status. To determine whether the business continuity plan established by each service is appropriate, mock training is conducted at least once a half term for each department for infringement accidents, personal information leakage accidents, or disasters. The plan is supplemented if necessary according to the results to prepare minimizing the impact in the event of an actual accident or disaster. In particular, considering that the DMZ zone system, which is open to the Internet, has a high impact in the event of an accident, the effectiveness of the applied security control items is also verified through mock control training. In 2023, web shell attacks were conducted for 31 services in the first and second half of the year, and the response process was improved by analyzing the results.
