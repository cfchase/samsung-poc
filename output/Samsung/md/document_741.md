Amid the rapidly evolving business environment, Samsung SDS has built and executed a sustainability management strategy to secure sustainable growth drivers and continuously create substantial ESG results. In particular, as environmental issues such as climate change emerge as a pending threat to human survival, companies are faced with demands from stakeholders to present specific carbon reduction measures and transition to an eco-friendly business model.

Building on technology capabilities and the nature of its business, Samsung SDS has set 'providing eco-friendly values' as the strategic direction in the environmental area to address climate change and support clients in taking climate actions. In line with this direction, we have identified leveraging technology to curb carbon emissions, providing eco-friendly products and services, and implementing an ESG value delivery system as our environmental strategic initiatives.
