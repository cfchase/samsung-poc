We comply with the fairness and legitimacy of subcontract transactions through prior deliberation of subcontract transactions that exceed a certain level.

## **4. Issue and retain printed documents**

We take the lead in establishing a fair trade order by introducing the Fair Trade Commission's principles on issuing and retaining printed contracts with subcontractors.

## **Fair Trade and Contract Agreements**

Samsung SDS includes the Code of Ethical Management in all subcontractor contracts to prevent unfair trade and fraudulent acts that may occur in the course of business with suppliers. We participated in a joint taskforce between the public and private sectors on improving standard subcontracting practices in the software business in 2012 and adopted standard subcontracting contracts recommended by the Fair Trade Commission that is currently applied to 4 software business sectors, 4 construction sectors, and 2 logistics sectors. In addition, we introduced electronic contracts through smart-together.com, our supplier portal, to prevent unfair trade practices such as verbal orders and unfair order cancellations.

Suppliers are selected and managed based on the 4 fair trade principles to select partners in a fair and transparent manner. Supplier selection criteria and procedures are notified through smart-together.com with specific and precise descriptions of our selection and evaluation standards to ensure there are no concerns of arbitrary interpretations by suppliers.

## **Supplier Selection Process**

## **Improvement in Payment Conditions**

To strengthen financial soundness of suppliers, subcontractor payments are made 3 times a month, within an average 10 days with all payments being 100% in cash. In addition, when a supplier requests early payment, Samsung SDS may review the request and make an early payment.
