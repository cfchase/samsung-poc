We conducted a risk analysis approach and on-site verification based on data evaluation, and we identified the appropriateness of the data and factors applied to GHG emission calculations based on objective evidence. The verification team verified the GHG emissions during the reporting period in a reasonable way based on the verification guidelines.

## **INDEPENDENT**

KMR does not have any stake in the verified entity and does not conduct verification with biased opinions/views. We have drawn an independent and objective verification conclusion based on the verification standards, and reviewed the every aspect of the verification we performed throughout the entire verification process through internal review.

## **LIMITATIONS**

The verification team verified the related reports, information and data presented by the audited institution by sampling or enumeration methods. As a result, there are many inherent limitations, and there may be disagreements in the interpretation of appropriateness. Although we have tried to faithfully perform verification that meets the verification standards, we suggest that errors, omissions, and false statements that could not be found may be latent as the limitations to the verification.

## **OPINION**

·GHG verification has been performed to meet the limited assurance level according to the verification standards.

·We express that no significant errors were found in the calculation of emissions during the verification process, and that relevant activity data and evidence were appropriately managed and calculated. As a result, we express an "unmodified" opinion.

·Criticality: meets the criterion, which is less than 5%
