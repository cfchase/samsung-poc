## **Strategy & Business Model**

Samsung SDS defines the time horizons for which risks and opportunities related to climate change are expected to be as follows: Short-term is the 1 year period following the reporting term (2024); Mid-term is the next 5 years (2025~2029); and the long-term refers to the next 20 years (2030~2050). These terms are also aligned with key decisions made by Samsung SDS on climate mitigation measures and targets and business plans, etc., as well as domestic climate reporting standards and ESRS which the company must observe.
