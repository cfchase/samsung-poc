## **Raising Employee Awareness**

Samsung SDS operate environment training programs and various campaigns to raise employee awareness on environmental management and encourage active participation.

## **Environmental Management Training**

In partnership with the Samsung Institute of EHS Strategy, we offer training programs on the general environment, air and water pollution prevention, recycling resources, renewable energy, greenhouse gases, and environmental management to our employees. In 2024, we plan to expand training to all employees by developing inhouse contents for environment training. Moreover, domestic and global environment officers completed internal auditor training in 2023 to apply ISO 14001 and ISO 50001 certified systems across all of our business sites. We are also issuing an environmental newsletter to help raise employee awareness on environmental matters.
