Samsung SDS conducts biannual employee appraisals. Early in the year, the evaluator and evaluatee discuss and set individual targets together based on each employee's work function using measurable quantitative figures, as much as possible, to guarantee fair and objective evaluations. When the evaluate undergoes a change in work responsibilities or department transfer, targets may be revised throughout the year. Evaluators encourage evaluatees to meet their targets and help them address difficulties faced along the way through regular interviews before, during, and after the appraisal. In addition, frequent feedback is shared to monitor progress during the year and to deliver input to support strengthening capabilities. When the evaluate has an objection to the appraisal outcome, ratings can be adjusted following deliberation by the Appraisal Objection Review Committee. We also provide tiered compensation based on the results of individual performance evaluations to enhance employee work efficiency.

## **Frequent Reviews and Peer Reviews**

To enhance credibility and fairness in evaluations, Samsung SDS operates frequent feedback and peer reviews. Evaluators can frequently deliver input on their evaluatee's progress in meeting work targets while collaboration can be promoted among colleagues through peer reviews which also support employees in understanding their strengths and weaknesses to better achieve performance targets.
