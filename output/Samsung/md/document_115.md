Pursuant to Article 35 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 10 of the BOD Regulations, BOD resolutions are made with the attendance of a majority of enrolled directors and with the consent of a majority of the attended directors (unless otherwise prescribed in relevant laws). Participation in resolutions by all or some directors of the Board without attending the meeting in person is permitted through telecommunications devices that allow voices of all of the directors to be transmitted and received simultaneously. In such cases, the director is considered as attending the BOD meeting in person. Each director's attendance rate and approval or disapproval for key agenda items that require disclosure are disclosed in the Business Report.

## **Board Evaluation**

Independent directors are evaluated regularly on an annual basis based on their individual activities and performance using evaluation criteria consisting of quantitative indicators such as BOD and committee meeting attendance rates and number of agenda items deliberated, and qualitative indicators such as expertise and understanding of the business. The evaluation results are leveraged as a key metric in determining reappointment.
