Last year, the ESG Committee convened six meetings where we engaged in active discussions on developing the corporate ESG strategy and its specific implementation plan. As a result, we devised Samsung SDS' own sustainability management strategy system along with a roadmap for 11 key strategic initiatives across each ESG area.

The ESG Committee will do our utmost again this year to ensure Samsung SDS carries out stable ESG management based on our ESG strategy and core values.

## **We will strengthen environmental management to contribute to a sustainable future.**

Samsung SDS obtained ISO 50001 certification for energy management systems at all global business sites in 2023. In terms of our business, we will continue to make efforts in curbing carbon emissions by developing energy-efficient data center technology and expanding low-carbon logistics services.

## **We will create a corporate culture that practices diversity, equity, and inclusion.**

Samsung SDS operates a wide range of maternity protection programs to support pregnancies and childcare for female employees in striking a balance between work and family life. Moreover, we aim to actively implement the global DEI (Diversity, Equity, Inclusion) initiative starting this year to create a working environment that can embrace employees from diverse backgrounds.

## **We will reinforce our sustainability management governance system.**

Samsung SDS adopted the Senior Independent Director System in 2023 to strengthen independence and transparency of the Board of Directors. We will strive to further reinforce our governance system for sustainability management by composing the Related Party Transaction Committee and the Independent Director Recommendation Committee under the BOD entirely with independent directors this year and reviewing independent director candidates once a year.

Thank you again for your trust and confidence in Samsung SDS.

We will look forward to your continuous attention and unwavering support.
