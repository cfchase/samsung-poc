Samsung SDS operates an independent and professional department that carries out mock hacking on internal systems, products, and solutions. The simulations help nurture security experts with hacking skills by operating mock hacking on all systems developed and operated by the company at least once a year. The exercise allows actual hacking tools and techniques to be used to obtain unauthorized access to systems or steal information which helps identify system vulnerabilities and take measures for the identified vulnerabilities to prevent security accidents.

## **2023 Mock Hacking Outcomes**

|---------------------|-----------------|----------------------------|------------------------|
| Mock Hacking Target | Inspection Rate | Vulnerabilities Identified | Action completion rate |
| 253                 | 100             | 679                        | 100%                   |

44 items are being inspected across the 6 categories of ① preventing change in input value (7), ② account and password management (5), ③ authentication and access management (7), ④ preventing data exposure (7), ⑤ safe environment settings (9), and ⑥ personal information management (9). We are also continuously studying new hacking techniques and analyzing new security issues to inspect and manage hacking vulnerabilities in advance. Mock hacking is being expanded beyond systems at headquarters to domestic and overseas subsidiaries with 7 vulnerabilities identified on the external open websites of domestic subsidiaries in 2023 and 5 identified at overseas subsidiaries. Actions have been completed for all detected vulnerabilities.

## **Personal Information System Management**

Led by the Privacy Management Group, regular inspections on privacy systems managed by Samsung SDS are carried out once a year. Each system is inspected for compliance with the Personal Information Protection Act and the company's internal privacy management plans based on its database, operator environment, system account and access authorization, etc. followed with countermeasures and monitoring. In 2023, inspection was carried out on 52 systems, and actions have been completed for the identified vulnerabilities.
