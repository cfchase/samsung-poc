We carry out various activities to promote security such as sending emails, posting news, and leveraging digital signage to inform employees about security compliance or changes in key information security policies. We offer a wide range of contents to raise employee awareness, utilizing digital signage (TVs, DID) at business sites to share case studies on compliance and security incidents. Information Security Letters were sent in the last week of each month in 2023 for topics including account management, malicious email, precautions for using ChatGPT and AI Chatbots, and security guidelines for business site access, etc., and key compliance requirements were displayed on digital signage to be visible to employees and visitors alike.

## **Mock Drills for Malicious Email**

Samsung SDS conducts employee mock drills for malicious email to prevent infections from malicious codes and raise awareness. A total 5 sessions were held in 2023, and infection risk rates have been dropping each year thanks to such simulation exercises.

## **Outcome of Mock Drills for Malicious Email**

Training covers topics such as how to identify malicious email when infection behavior are found such as clicking links, viewing attachments, and inserting account information, etc. and tips for prevention. Employees who have been exposed to infection risks 2 or more times are subject to separate security training. To improve the effect of training, we shared the training method and contents with our domestic and overseas subsidiaries in 2023 for them to apply which resulted in infection risks falling from 3.6% in 2022 to 1.5%.
