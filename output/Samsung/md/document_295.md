## **Strengthening Board Independence**

Samsung SDS has a majority of independent directors to ensure independence of the BOD and operates meetings that encourage open discussions and independent decision-making. In addition, transactions between directors and the company are restricted and directors who have an interest in a BOD resolution are prohibited from exercising their voting rights in order to minimize conflicts of interest. We form a pool of candidates by examining factors such as qualifications, business experience, and interests with the company to ensure fairness and independence in the appointment of directors while the BOD and Independent Director Recommendation Committee comprehensively consider evaluation criteria for individual candidates including expertise, social recognition, and integrity along with Board diversity, and the business environment at the time of appointment to select candidates. In addition, the Independent Director Recommendation Committee will meet once a year from 2024 onward to reinforce operations. This year, the committee meet on April 25 with all of its members attending to review candidates and discuss the direction for committee operations going forward.

## **Board Diversity and Expertise**

Samsung SDS composes its BOD with directors who have diverse expertise to enable strategic decision-makings from a comprehensive perspective. The CEO, a leading expert in IT services, oversees the overall business and drives responsible management as the BOD chair. Furthermore, we appoint experts with deep knowledge and experience in various fields such as law, IT, finance, and business strategy as independent directors who provide objective management supervision and professional advice. Independent directors are limited to holding dual positions at one company to ensure their expertise and loyalty. Samsung SDS is committed to growing alongside its stakeholders and advocates diversity factors such as gender, age, nationality, education, and political affiliation, etc.
