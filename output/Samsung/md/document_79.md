Samsung SDS has a systemized process for responding to accidents involving an employee or supplier worker that includes accident investigations and reports to building and implementing prevention measures, as well as horizontally cascading learnings to other business sites. We operate reporting systems based on the type and extent of the accident and analyze the cause to prevention measures. Afterwards, the knowledge-sharing program called 'Learning from Mistakes' for horizontal deployment manages situations to prevent similar accidents from recurring.

## **Safety & Health Training at Business Sites**

Samsung SDS develops safety and health training contents each year to be used in online training for employees. In addition, skill training for Safety & Health Management Officers and safety managers, as well as specialized training for workers at logistics centers and construction sites are also offered as part of our diverse safety and health training efforts.

## **Emergency Drills**

To protect employees through quick evacuations during emergency situations such as fires, Samsung SDS conducts emergency drills twice a year. Emergency response scenarios are built for key business sites including the Jamsil Campus, data centers, and logistics centers, and role-based drills are conducted to make ongoing improvements to the emergency response system.

## **Safety & Health of Suppliers**

## **Priority Management of Suppliers**

We operate safety management systems at suppliers who are relatively vulnerable to risks of occupational hazards. Site training tailored to the working environment at high-risk locations such as logistics centers and construction projects and incentives for best practices are offered to maintain a healthy and safe environment for our suppliers.
