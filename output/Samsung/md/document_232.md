Samsung SDS analyzed water-related risks using the Aqueduct Water Risk Framework provided by the WRI (World Resource Institute) based on the location of each of our business sites. Risks were categorized into physical risks related to quantity, physical risks related to quality, and regulatory and reputational risks based on the nature of the risk, and then broken down again into the 5 levels of Low, Low-Medium, Medium-High, High, and Extremely High depending on their level of impact.

## **Categorization of Water Risks**

## **Physical Risks Related to Quantity**

Physical risks related to quantity refer to risks that come from an oversupply of shortage of water resources.

·Water stress: Ratio of available water supply compared to water demand (measuring water withdrawal for both consumption and non-consumption purposes)

·Water Depletion: Ratio of water supply compared to water demand (similar to water stress but only based on consumption-based water withdrawal)

·Inter-annual variability : Average annual variation of available water supply

·Seasonal variability: Average water availability variability within a year

·Groundwater table decline: Average annual decrease rate of groundwater

·Riverine flood risk: Ratio of population affected by river inundations from floods

·Coastal flood risk: Ratio of population affected by from coastal floods

·Drought risk: Population and assets exposed to possible droughts and risks

## **Physical Risks Related to Quality**

Physical risks related to quality refer to risks regarding poor water quality that make it unavailable for use.

·Untreated connected wastewater: Ratio of domestic wastewater that has not gone through preliminary treatment

·Coastal eutrophication potential: Possibility of harmful algal blooms due to accumulated nitrogen, phosphorous, and silicon

## **Regulatory and Reputational Risks**
