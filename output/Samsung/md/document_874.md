## **Security Monitoring and Control**

Samsung SDS has a 24/7 security monitoring and control system that monitors security threats to the IT system around the clock such as external attack attempts and information leaks and analyzes data logs gathered from security equipment when threats are detected. We define essential control items that are applied by system archetype and conduct regular reviews to maintain a high level of security and safety.

## **Risk Management**

The Information Security Department identifies potential security risks by analyzing the internal and external environment and internal security inspection results, and determines their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability losses regarding all of our information assets. Based on the impact analysis, a risk assessment is carried out at least once a year to analyze security vulnerabilities for each information asset type. We manage the identified risks through a process where strategies and protection measures are selected with relevant departments and officers, and implementation plans are built and reported to management to confirm whether measures are taken. During risk assessments in the following year, mitigation of risks identified in the previous year are reassessed which is included in the Risk Assessment Report submitted each year for external certification and audits on information security practices for objective evaluation. In 2023, 10 risks were identified, and actions have been completed based on the protection measures which have been reflected in the information security management system.
