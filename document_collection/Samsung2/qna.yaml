        Now, let us review the Q2 earnings. Please refer to the first page of
        the earnings presentation slides.

        In Q2, our revenue was KRW 3.37 trillion, a 3.7% increase from the
        previous quarter and a 2.4% increase year-over-year.

        Looking at the profit, the gross profit was KRW 500 billion, a 1.9%
        increase from the previous quarter and a 12.7% improvement
        year-over-year. The gross profit margin was 14.8%, a 0.3 percentage
        point decrease from the previous quarter but a 1.3 percentage point
        improvement year-over-year.

        Next is the operating profit for Q2. Operating profit was KRW 221
        billion, a 2% decrease from the previous quarter but a 7% increase
        year-over-year. The operating profit margin was 6.6%, a 0.4 percentage
        point decrease from the previous quarter but a 0.3 percentage point
        increase year-over-year.

        Net profit was KRW 190 billion, a 12.2% decrease from the previous
        quarter but an 11.8% increase year-over-year.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          What was Samsung SDS's revenue in Q2 of 2024?
        answer: |
          In the 2nd quarter of 2024, Samsung SDS had a revenue of KRW
          3.37 trillion.
      - question: |
          For Samsung SDS in the second quarter of 2024, what was the gross
          profit?
        answer: |
          Samsung SDS had a gross profit of KRW 500 billion in Q2 of 2024.
          This was a 1.9% increase from the preceding quarter, and
          represents a 12.7 improvement year-over-year.
      - question: |
          Did Samsung SDS see net profit growth in Q2 2024?
        answer: |
          The answer to this is complex. In one sense, net profit grew, but
          in another sense, it did not grow. Samsung SDS had a net profit of
          KRW 190 billion in Q2 of 2024. This was a 12.2% decrease from the
          previous quarter, so it was not growth based on the previous quarter.
          However, year-over-year this net profit represents a 11.8% increase
          year-over-year, so net profit shows growth year-over-year for Q2 2024.

      ## [Logistics Business Division]

      Good afternoon, I am Kooil O, Executive Vice President of the Logistics
      Division at Samsung SDS. I will explain the major achievements of the
      logistics business in Q2, market outlook and our business strategy for the
      second half.

      In Q2, logistics business revenue was KRW 1.78 trillion, a 5.3% increase
      from the previous quarter. By logistics segment, ocean transport revenue
      increased in Q2 compared to last quarter due to the early peak season
      caused by major country tariff policies and the Red Sea issue as well as
      rising freight rate. However, air transport revenue decreased in Q2 due to
      the completion of new product transportation for major customers in Q1.
      Inland transport and warehouse logistics revenue increased compared to the
      previous quarter due to increased cargo volume in North America.

      Cello Square revenue in Q2 was KRW 285 billion, a 12% increase from the
      previous quarter. Overseas revenue is expanding in regions such as China,
      North America, and Europe as well. The number of registered customers
      increased by 2,000 from the previous quarter to 14,800, and the cumulative
      number of shipment customers also increased by 15%.

      We continuously improve competitiveness of customer services and
      operational productivity using generative AI. To minimize the impact of
      global supply chain risks on customers' global operations, we collect
      60,000 news items daily and analyze their relevance to logistics so that
      we can detect logistics-related risks at an early stage and establish
      response plans. We analyze importance and estimate cargo volume using
      generative AI to minimize the impact on customers' businesses.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How is the revenue looking for Samsung SDS's logistics business

      In the financial sector, the easing of regulations is accelerating the
      transformation to cloud-based systems. After major banks, insurance
      companies and other second-ti er financial institutions are now beginning
      to implement next-generation cloud systems. Also, interest in applying new
      technologies such as generative AI is also increasing.

      The financial IT business is largely composed of core system, information
      system, and channel system. The core system is the unique business system
      of financial institutions, such as loans and deposits. The information
      system is the system for storing and analyzing data related to customers
      and operations, and the channel system is the system used directly by
      customers, such as internet banking and mobile banking. In Q2, our
      financial business secured core system implementation projects for large
      banks such as KDB Bank and information system projects for the insurance
      industry such as ABL Life Insurance. We also secured generative AI
      platform implementation projects in two large commercial banks.

      In the second half, we plan to focus on core system implementation
      projects in the insurance industry and information system projects using
      generative AI technology for data analysis and real-time marketing in the
      second-tier financial sector.

      We do not expect the profit margin to be significantly affected by the
      business we are promoting. We're set to lead the market by providing
      unique value-added services that distinguish SDS, driven by our expertise
      in cloud and generative AI technologies.

      The CrowdStrike incident is related to security solutions rather than CSP
      issues. As security solutions are necessary for all companies, it can be
      an opportunity for CSPs that can manage them well. MSP providers with
      well-organized procedures and problem-solving capabilities will be highly
      sought after.

      ## A2: Haegoo Song, Vice President of Solution Business Division

      The smart factory business is broadly divided into traditional MES
      business and digital twin business using new technologies.

      In the traditional MES business, some new cloud MES companies are
      emerging in the global market, but the nature of MES, which requires high
      stability, means that onpremise MES business is still dominant.
      Therefore, we do not see a significant market change domestically, and we
      continue to support the MES business of Samsung affiliates, primarily
      focusing on overseas factory expansion. We are actively supporting
      Samsung affiliates' overseas business expansion across various
      industries, and there would be no significant change to this approach.

      The digital twin business is not yet prominent in large-scale projects,
      but some companies are trying new approaches. Our company is conducting
      technical verification projects to establish digital twin roadmaps for
      operational automation in key facilities such as semiconductor
      manufacturing plants, implementing digital twins using 3D data,
      identifying optimal production conditions through simulation linkage, as
      well as providing an environment where the results can be verified on the
      digital twin platform.

      We plan to expand the application scope of digital twins to areas such as
      remote setup pre-verification for reducing lead times of new factory
      setup and layout changes, but

      we do not yet expect significant growth in this area and consider it a
      field where various new technologies are being pilot-tested across
      different domains. We will update our business plans based on the
      progress of these technology verifications and market outlook.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          Do large-scale projects in the smart factory business involve
          digital twins?
        answer: |
          Large-scale projects do not yet involve the digital twin business
          in a prominent way. Samsung SDS is looking to establish digital twin
          roadmaps via technical verification projects with an eye towards
          operational automation in semiconductor manufacturing plants. The
          implementation of digital twins using 3D data is a part of this
          effort.
      - question: |
          Is it expected that the digital twin business will grow significantly
          as part of the smart factory business?
        answer: |
          There is a planned application scope for digital twins, but Samsung
          SDS does not anticipate significant growth in the area of using
          digital twin technology for factory setup and layout changes.
      - question: |
          What are the two major components of the Samsung SDS smart factory
          business?
        answer: |
          Samsung SDS' smart factory business is comprised of the traditional
          MES business, and a digital twin business using new technologies.
