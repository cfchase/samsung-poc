      ## Message from the CEO

      Samsung SDS is dedicated to the sustainable growth of various stakeholders
      by embedding ESG values in the company's business and management
      activities.

      ## Greetings! I am Sungwoo Hwang, President and CEO of Samsung SDS.

      It is a great pleasure to extend my warmest appreciation for your
      continuous affection and encouragement toward Samsung SDS as we present
      you with the 5th Samsung SDS Sustainability Report. Samsung SDS has made
      endeavors to transform its fundamental business model by focusing on the
      cloud and digital logistics businesses during the past three years. As a
      result, our cloud business saw revenues grow 62% in 2023 compared to the
      previous year with its revenue share in IT Services also increasing from
      19% in 2022 to 31% in 2023. Our digital logistics business also expanded
      its service offerings steadily through Cello Square, increasing coverage
      to 13 countries and recording 129% year-on-year growth. Moreover, 2023 was
      the first year for all Samsung SDS services and solutions to be armored
      with generative AI.

      Amid such changes, Samsung SDS is practicing a strategy to embed ESG
      values in the business under the vision 'IT's the Key to Sustainable
      Growth' to ensure all of the company's business activities contribute to
      the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders.

      Taking into account that climate change is an urgent issue threatening the
      sustainability of our society, we are upgrading management of carbon
      emissions generated from our products and services. We built a real-time
      monitoring system to offer customers visibility on the carbon emissions
      related to our cloud and logistics services and are pursuing investments
      in high-efficiency equipment and adoption of new technologies such as
      immersion cooling to realize energy efficiency innovations at datacenters.
      We also plan to actively assist our customers in addressing ESG matters by
      leveraging IT technology to discover emissionreducing factors and securing
      supply chain ESG management functions.

      Moreover, we are devoted to protecting the data and information of
      everyone related to the company including our customers. With generative
      AI triggering unprecedented change across society, there is growing need
      for ethical principles and guidelines to be applied our AI-based services.
      Therefore, we plan to establish a digital governance system that includes
      policies and technical solutions for offering responsible and fair IT
      services that embrace AI ethics and privacy protection.

      The ESG paradigm in business is now going beyond the establishment of
      systems and plans to actual practice and performance creation.
      Transparency in ESG data is becoming increasingly important as regulations
      on mandatory ESG reporting are announced around the world including in
      Korea, the U.S., and Europe. Samsung SDS will concentrate on practical
      efforts to bring about substantial results and manage information
      systematically through an ESG data platform to provide information
      transparently to our stakeholders.

      We look forward to your ongoing interest and support towards our journey
      towards a sustainable future.

      Thank you.

      Sungwoo Hwang

      President & CEO of Samsung SDS

      ## Sustainability Management Strategy

      ## ENVIRONMENTAL

      ## Key Performance

      10% energy efficiency improvement Adoption of high-efficiency equipment
      at Suwon DC

      Amid the rapidly evolving business environment, Samsung SDS has built and
      executed a sustainability management strategy to secure sustainable
      growth drivers and continuously create substantial ESG results. In
      particular, as environmental issues such as climate change emerge as a
      pending threat to human survival, companies are faced with demands from
      stakeholders to present specific carbon reduction measures and transition
      to an eco-friendly business model.

      Building on technology capabilities and the nature of its business,
      Samsung SDS has set 'providing eco-friendly values' as the strategic
      direction in the environmental area to address climate change and support
      clients in taking climate actions. In line with this direction, we have
      identified leveraging technology to curb carbon emissions, providing
      eco-friendly products and services, and implementing an ESG value
      delivery system as our environmental strategic initiatives.

      ## Leverage Technology to Curb Carbon Emissions

      Based on technical knowhow, Samsung SDS is working hard to continuously
      lower carbon emissions. We are making efforts especially at our data
      centers to achieve low-power, high-efficiency operations by discovering
      and applying new technologies.

      ## Performance and Next Steps

      As part of our carbon mitigation efforts, we replaced outdated equipment
      at the Suwon DC in 2023. We introduced high-efficiency UPS equipment
      which improved energy efficiency by more than 10% (85.4 → 95.9%) and cut
      energy usage by adopting inverters for engine power equipment.

      ## Minimize UPS

      Installing UPS to power supply on one side can minimize power loss during
      blackouts an allow switching between power supplies

      In addition, simulations were made on cooling methods to compare power
      usage effectiveness (PUE), and on the immersion cooling system to test
      its performance and build a database.

      Immersion cooling proof of concept (PoC) was carried out for its
      introduction to data centers in 2024 which is expected to serve as the
      basis for us developing technology requirements and operation standards.

      Beginning in 2026, we will conduct phased implementation of the system,
      using immersion cooling to significantly lower power consumption and
      mitigate carbon emissions by an annual 1,298 tCO$_{2}$eq/MW. Moreover, we
      expect to save KRW 400 million/MW in annual operating costs compared to
      conventional cooling.

      Continuing to expand adoption of new technologies for low-power and
      high-efficiency data center operations, we will deliver ESG values to
      customers through an eco-cloud in the long-term.

      ## Immersive Liquid Cooling

      A next-generation cooling solution to efficiently cool heated IT
      equipment where IT equipment are immersed in a special electrically non-
      conductive fluid to cool down without requiring an additional cooling
      device
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: |
          How much energy efficient improvement was realized at the Suwon DC,
          and how?
        answer: |
          In 2023, outdated equipment was replaced with high-efficiency
          equipment at the Suwon DC. This lead to more than 10% energy
          efficient improvement - efficiency went from 85.4% to 95.9%. Energy
          usage was lowered by adopting inverters for engine power equipment.
      - question: |
          What is Samsung SDS doing with immersion cooling?
        answer: |
          An immersion cooling proof of concept was created for
          introduction into Samsung SDS datacenters in 2024. Samsung SDS will
          conduct phased implementation of the system starting in 2026. It is
          expected that KRW 400 million/MW will be saved in annual operating
          costs compared to conventional cooling. Carbon emissions should be
          lowered by 1,298 tCO2 eq/MW.
      - question: |
          What is immersive liquid cooling?
        answer: |
          Immersive liquid cooling is a next-generation cooling solution that
          is more efficient than conventional cooling system. This solution
          involves immersing IT equipment in electrically non-conductive fluid
          that cools the equipment down without the usage of additional cooling
          devices.

      ## Incentive Programs

      Based on the results of ESG inspections of suppliers, Samsung SDS
      supports incentive programs for suppliers demonstrating excellent ESG
      management. These incentives motivate participation in ESG practices and
      raise aware-ness about the necessity for ESG. In 2023, a total 8
      suppliers were recognized as Excellent ESG Suppliers, receiving practical
      incentives for a sustainable future such as exemptions from on-site
      inspections in the following year, support for suppliers' education
      expenses, and financial support through the Win-Win Management Fund.
