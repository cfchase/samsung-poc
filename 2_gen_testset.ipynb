Cello manages transport data across all routes used to calculate emissions, securing reliability in calculations by utilizing EcoTransIT. A customized dashboard is provided to each of our customers, allowing emissions in the supply chain to be monitored immediately for control to support customers in managing emissions effectively throughout the logistics process.\\n\\nThe dashboard gives customers complete visibility into the emissions of all transport modes in the supply chain. This includes not only international routes, but also local routes and even emissions from logistics centers. Moreover, various types of analyses are supported such as carbon emissions and intensity, monthly and annual emissions trends, and information on top emission routes. This way, customers can manage emissions more efficiently across periods, routes, and transport modes associated with high carbon emissions.\\n\\n## **Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System**\\n\\nWe set up the Cello Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System to manage emissions systematically across the 200 logistics centers operating in 35 countries worldwide.

Based on the standards, ESG levels of suppliers are checked through a systematic process that includes receiving compliance agreements to the Code of Conduct, self-inspections, site inspections, and third-party assurance (operations) to make necessary improvements and strengthen capabilities (follow-up). In addition, the basic agreements with suppliers shall contain clauses on social responsibilities (compliance with Code of Conduct)) and be signed through the procurement system.\\n\\n## **Supplier Inspection Process**\\n\\n## **Managing Suppliers' Climate Actions**\\n\\nTo manage environmental information of suppliers, Samsung SDS joined the CDP's (Carbon Disclosure Project) Supply Chain Program to gather information on GHG emissions and renewable energy consumption aligned with CDP standards. As of 2023, 53 suppliers are taking part in the CDP Supply Chain Program. In addition, ESG consulting carried out guides on calculating GHG emissions to strengthen the GHG management of suppliers. Along with training on GHG mitigation awareness, GHG calculations will be performed at selected key suppliers in 2024 to identify best practices and continuously cascade to other suppliers.\\n\\n77\\n\\n## **ESG for Suppliers**\\n\\n## **Supply Chain ESG**\\n\\n## **Supply Chain ESG Evaluation**\\n\\n## **Evaluation Process**\\n\\nSamsung SDS evaluates suppliers through a systematic process of planning, execution, assessment, and planning and monitoring improvements.

These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.\\n\\nTop 5 Asset Types by Asset Value\\n\\nData Center - Owner/Occupier : $1,472m, Data Center-Tenant : $71m, Office - Tenant : $36m\\n\\nMAAL (Modeled Average Annual Loss): Estimated losses and loss ratio compared to current asset value, including operating costs, capital costs incurred due to loss rates, and costs due to business disruptions as losses\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n48\\n\\n## **SPECIAL SECTION**\\n\\n## **CLIMATE REPORT**\\n\\n## **Strategy & Business Model**\\n\\n## **Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario**\\n\\nManaging the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.\\n\\nOf the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.\"),\n",

In accordance with the Environment and Energy Management Principles established in 2023, the CEO regularly receives reports on the climate change response policy and progress in meeting targets to respond to the climate crisis and achieve carbon neutrality in the mid-to-long-term. In addition, the CEO supports the ESG Council to carry out its role in deliberating and making decisions on key agenda. The CFO of Samsung SDS not only manages the financial structure and business strategy, but also oversees overall environmental management issues as the executive in charge of environmental matters of the company to ensure the ESG strategy is carried out effectively by relevant businesses and departments. In addition, the CFO serves as the Chief Risk Officer (CRO) that identifies and manages corporate risks to report identified climate risks and assessments to the BOD to support the CEO in making important business decisions.\\n\\n## **Key Role of CEO and CFO regarding Climate Change**\"),\n",

Acting as a cloud service provider (CSP) and cloud management service provider (MSP), we conduct various activities to ensure a robust cloud security system. Samsung SDS prioritizes the introduction of an SCP-based Identity Access Management (IAM) solution, or Single ID, the development of various Software as a Service (SaaS)-type endpoint security solutions, and the automation of malware detection and security measures leveraging artificial intelligence and machine learning. Owing to these efforts, Samsung SDS' cloud security capabilities have gained international recognition, receiving accolades such as the Security Company of the Year from Frost & Sullivan for three consecutive years (2020-2022). In 2022, we were recognized as a major player in the worldwide cloud security services market by IDC, as reported in their IDC MarketScape Cloud Security Services Report.\\n\\n## **Cloud Security Inspections**\\n\\nWith the increase in cloud environments, Samsung SDS has developed new security guides for each type of cloud and shared it with employees to provide standards for building and using safe cloud environments. In addition, we prepared a separate checklist for the cloud environment and are expanding inspection targets and automatic inspections to strengthen management of a safe cloud environment. Inspection scopes were expanded in 2023 to include a total 25 public cloud services used by 3 of our subsidiaries in inspections and identified 172 vulnerabilities. Immediate action was taken on 109 substantial items and are taking continuous measures and improvements on other items with weak security management for ongoing improvement and management of the cloud security environment.\\n\\n## **2023 Cloud Security Inspection Outcome**\"),\n",

Accordingly, periodic inspections are conducted for each business division to ensure that security levels such as access control and authorization management for backup system administration accounts, network configuration, and log management are being managed at a level similar to that of the operating system. In 2023, the inspection scope for backup servers was expanded from domestic business sites to backup systems of overseas subsidiaries, and the found vulnerabilities were fixed.\\n\\n## **Business Continuity Plan for Systems**\\n\\nWe have established and operated 'Business Continuity Management' guidelines with common standards for preparing against natural disasters and security incidents that can occur despite various prevention management activities. A department dedicated to disaster and accident prevention and response has been formed, and the person in charge of each system establishes a business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems, we establish detailed processes for establishing and operating a DR center and manage implementation status. To determine whether the business continuity plan established by each service is appropriate, mock training is conducted at least once a half term for each department for infringement accidents, personal information leakage accidents, or disasters. The plan is supplemented if necessary according to the results to prepare minimizing the impact in the event of an actual accident or disaster. In particular, considering that the DMZ zone system, which is open to the Internet, has a high impact in the event of an accident, the effectiveness of the applied security control items is also verified through mock control training.

In addition, we comply with anti-corruption and anti-bribery laws and regulations which are being globally reinforced, as well as thoroughly mange economic/social losses and external risks that may arise from unethical business practices.

The senior independent director can arrange and convene meetings among the independent directors and supports communication between outside directors and the BOD Chair and members of management. Furthermore, composition of the Independent Director Recommendation Committee was changed to all outside directors in 2024 to advance the independent director screening process.

The system requires conversions between AC and DC to switch between charging and discharging as UPS receives power supply from batteries in the event of power outages or voltage drops. The Suwon Data Center replaced its outdated UPS system with a modular high-efficiency UPS and old lead acid batteries with high-durability lithium-ion batteries to minimize the massive amount of electrical energy being lost in the form of heat energy during the conversion. Introduction of the high-efficiency UPS was found to have improved overall performance by around 10%, reducing approximately 565 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Transformers**\\n\\nWhile extra high-voltage power is supplied to data centers to support their massive use of energy, transformers are needed to step down the voltages and make necessary adjustments to be used by IT equipment and other facilities. The Suwon Data Center used oil-filled transformers with insulating oil that serve as insulators and coolants but switched to mold transformers that use epoxy resin for insulation and cooling. Mold transformers are space efficient, allowing for high-efficiency designs within same volume areas. The replacement resulted in 304 tons of GHG emission reductions.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n## **Cooling Towers**'),\n",

The system requires conversions between AC and DC to switch between charging and discharging as UPS receives power supply from batteries in the event of power outages or voltage drops. The Suwon Data Center replaced its outdated UPS system with a modular high-efficiency UPS and old lead acid batteries with high-durability lithium-ion batteries to minimize the massive amount of electrical energy being lost in the form of heat energy during the conversion. Introduction of the high-efficiency UPS was found to have improved overall performance by around 10%, reducing approximately 565 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Transformers**\\n\\nWhile extra high-voltage power is supplied to data centers to support their massive use of energy, transformers are needed to step down the voltages and make necessary adjustments to be used by IT equipment and other facilities. The Suwon Data Center used oil-filled transformers with insulating oil that serve as insulators and coolants but switched to mold transformers that use epoxy resin for insulation and cooling. Mold transformers are space efficient, allowing for high-efficiency designs within same volume areas. The replacement resulted in 304 tons of GHG emission reductions.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n## **Cooling Towers**'),\n",

In particular, in the case of policy risks, we conducted a scenario analysis using S&P Global's methodology to increase the reliability of the analysis. First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts. Market risks were calculated by assessing the cost of switching to renewable energy in the power sector through analysis of the supply price of renewable energy, while reputational risks were analyzed based on the financial impact on revenues resulting from increased negative stakeholder feedback due to inadequate climate-related disclosure and greenwashing.\"),\n",

After the contest is over, solutions to the challenges are revealed and feedback from participants are incorporated through post-surveys. Survey results showed high levels of employee satisfaction as they could gain deeper understanding on security threats and vulnerabilities seen from various perspectives that need to be considered in the system development process by attempting to solve the challenges and learning from the online solutions afterwards. We will continue to seek distinctive and engaging methods to apply to training and guides to support employees in experiencing the latest security techniques and strengthening secure coding technologies and capabilities.\\n\\nSamsung SDS has a separate internal system for privacy protection, as well. The 'Privacy Internal Management Plan' which is the company's standards for privacy management can be viewed on this system along with essential legal information and news and contents related to personal information.

In particular, in the case of policy risks, we conducted a scenario analysis using S&P Global's methodology to increase the reliability of the analysis. First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts. Market risks were calculated by assessing the cost of switching to renewable energy in the power sector through analysis of the supply price of renewable energy, while reputational risks were analyzed based on the financial impact on revenues resulting from increased negative stakeholder feedback due to inadequate climate-related disclosure and greenwashing.\"),\n",

Previous closed-type chillers isolate cooling liquids from the atmosphere and has an advantage in terms of being less affected by external contamination. However, such closed-type cooling towers use brines (EG solutions) to prevent freezing in the winter which requires a separate process for discharging or disposal to prevent environmental pollution, as well as an additional feed water pump that results in more energy consumption than open-type cooling towers. The Suwon Data Center replaced its closed-type cooling towers with high-efficiency open-types that can be controlled based on cooling loads and reduced around 952 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Temperature and Humidity Chambers**\\n\\nMost of the electrical energy used by IT equipment in computing is emitted as heat energy which is why large capacity cooling facilities are essential at data centers.

GHG emissions at Samsung SDS are projected to continue to increase as our business grows which can trigger a severe climate risk. Acknowledging the importance of the environment, Samsung SDS implements and operates data centers equipped with the latest energy mitigation technologies to reduce this climate risk. Moreover, we plan to make a 100% transition to renewable energy by expanding solar power generation facilities and making REC purchases.

As part of our corporate information security policies, we have a 'Security Incident Response' guideline that defines response and follow-up measures for incidents classified based on degree of impact with specific procedures being developed and operated by the Incident Response Department. In the event of a security incident, the dedicated department quickly forward the case to relevant departments to minimize impact while material incidents are reported to management to ensure there are no issues in the response measures taken. Afterwards, the cause of the incident is analyzed, and preventive measures are devised along with a review of the response process to incorporate necessary improvements going forward. The Corporate Information Security Department also reviews security incidents and process improvements to revise the 'security incident response' guideline twice a year, once in the first half and once in the second half of the year, to ensure effective response systems are in pace to address potential incidents.\\n\\n## **Status of Information Security**\\n\\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------|------|------|\\n| Category                                                                                                   | Unit        | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\\n| Information security breach or cyber security incidents                                                    | Cases       |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n| Total number of data leak incidents                                                                        | Cases       |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n| Total number of customers affected by data leaks                                                           | Persons     |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n| Total amount of fines or penalties paid due to information  security breaches and cyber security incidents | KRW million |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n\\n120\\n\\n## **Information Security**\\n\\n## **Raising Awareness on Security**\\n\\n## **Information Security Training**\"),\n",

I am Sungwoo Hwang, President and CEO of Samsung SDS.**\\n\\nIt is a great pleasure to extend my warmest appreciation for your continuous affection and encouragement toward Samsung SDS as we present you with the 5th Samsung SDS Sustainability Report. Samsung SDS has made endeavors to transform its fundamental business model by focusing on the cloud and digital logistics businesses during the past three years. As a result, our cloud business saw revenues grow 62% in 2023 compared to the previous year with its revenue share in IT Services also increasing from 19% in 2022 to 31% in 2023. Our digital logistics business also expanded its service offerings steadily through Cello Square, increasing coverage to 13 countries and recording 129% year-on-year growth. Moreover, 2023 was the first year for all Samsung SDS services and solutions to be armored with generative AI.\\n\\nAmid such changes, Samsung SDS is practicing a strategy to embed ESG values in the business under the vision 'IT's the Key to Sustainable Growth' to ensure all of the company's business activities contribute to the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders.\\n\\nTaking into account that climate change is an urgent issue threatening the sustainability of our society, we are upgrading management of carbon emissions generated from our products and services. We built a real-time monitoring system to offer customers visibility on the carbon emissions related to our cloud and logistics services and are pursuing investments in high-efficiency equipment and adoption of new technologies such as immersion cooling to realize energy efficiency innovations at datacenters. We also plan to actively assist our customers in addressing ESG matters by leveraging IT technology to discover emissionreducing factors and securing supply chain ESG management functions.\"),\n",

First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts. Market risks were calculated by assessing the cost of switching to renewable energy in the power sector through analysis of the supply price of renewable energy, while reputational risks were analyzed based on the financial impact on revenues resulting from increased negative stakeholder feedback due to inadequate climate-related disclosure and greenwashing.\"),\n",

I am Sungwoo Hwang, President and CEO of Samsung SDS.**\\n\\nIt is a great pleasure to extend my warmest appreciation for your continuous affection and encouragement toward Samsung SDS as we present you with the 5th Samsung SDS Sustainability Report. Samsung SDS has made endeavors to transform its fundamental business model by focusing on the cloud and digital logistics businesses during the past three years. As a result, our cloud business saw revenues grow 62% in 2023 compared to the previous year with its revenue share in IT Services also increasing from 19% in 2022 to 31% in 2023. Our digital logistics business also expanded its service offerings steadily through Cello Square, increasing coverage to 13 countries and recording 129% year-on-year growth. Moreover, 2023 was the first year for all Samsung SDS services and solutions to be armored with generative AI.\\n\\nAmid such changes, Samsung SDS is practicing a strategy to embed ESG values in the business under the vision 'IT's the Key to Sustainable Growth' to ensure all of the company's business activities contribute to the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders.\\n\\nTaking into account that climate change is an urgent issue threatening the sustainability of our society, we are upgrading management of carbon emissions generated from our products and services. We built a real-time monitoring system to offer customers visibility on the carbon emissions related to our cloud and logistics services and are pursuing investments in high-efficiency equipment and adoption of new technologies such as immersion cooling to realize energy efficiency innovations at datacenters. We also plan to actively assist our customers in addressing ESG matters by leveraging IT technology to discover emissionreducing factors and securing supply chain ESG management functions.\"),\n",
       " Document(metadata={'source': 'output/Samsung/md/document_216.md'}, page_content='Data Centers use cooling towers to effectively remove the heat generated from large capacity chillers. Previous closed-type chillers isolate cooling liquids from the atmosphere and has an advantage in terms of being less affected by external contamination. However, such closed-type cooling towers use brines (EG solutions) to prevent freezing in the winter which requires a separate process for discharging or disposal to prevent environmental pollution, as well as an additional feed water pump that results in more energy consumption than open-type cooling towers. The Suwon Data Center replaced its closed-type cooling towers with high-efficiency open-types that can be controlled based on cooling loads and reduced around 952 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Temperature and Humidity Chambers**\\n\\nMost of the electrical energy used by IT equipment in computing is emitted as heat energy which is why large capacity cooling facilities are essential at data centers. The temperature and humidity chamber supplies cool air inside server rooms, but previous models with fixed-speed fans could not be controlled based on cooling loads and had heavy energy consumption. Replacing these outdated models with temperature-based control high-efficiency models, the Suwon Data Center reduced around 1,494 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Data Center Eco-friendly Investments**\\n\\n|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------|------|\\n| Category          | Item                                             | Unit            | 2023 |\\n| Suwon Data Center | Adoption of open-type cooling tower and inverter | KRW 100 million |  111 |\\n\\n42\\n\\n## **Climate Action**\\n\\n## **GHG Emissions Reduction at Business Sites**\\n\\n## **Transition of Business Vehicles to Zero-emission Vehicles**'),\n",

I am Sungwoo Hwang, President and CEO of Samsung SDS.**\\n\\nIt is a great pleasure to extend my warmest appreciation for your continuous affection and encouragement toward Samsung SDS as we present you with the 5th Samsung SDS Sustainability Report. Samsung SDS has made endeavors to transform its fundamental business model by focusing on the cloud and digital logistics businesses during the past three years. As a result, our cloud business saw revenues grow 62% in 2023 compared to the previous year with its revenue share in IT Services also increasing from 19% in 2022 to 31% in 2023. Our digital logistics business also expanded its service offerings steadily through Cello Square, increasing coverage to 13 countries and recording 129% year-on-year growth. Moreover, 2023 was the first year for all Samsung SDS services and solutions to be armored with generative AI.\\n\\nAmid such changes, Samsung SDS is practicing a strategy to embed ESG values in the business under the vision 'IT's the Key to Sustainable Growth' to ensure all of the company's business activities contribute to the sustainable growth of our customers and stakeholders.\\n\\nTaking into account that climate change is an urgent issue threatening the sustainability of our society, we are upgrading management of carbon emissions generated from our products and services. We built a real-time monitoring system to offer customers visibility on the carbon emissions related to our cloud and logistics services and are pursuing investments in high-efficiency equipment and adoption of new technologies such as immersion cooling to realize energy efficiency innovations at datacenters.

Based on the standards, ESG levels of suppliers are checked through a systematic process that includes receiving compliance agreements to the Code of Conduct, self-inspections, site inspections, and third-party assurance (operations) to make necessary improvements and strengthen capabilities (follow-up). In addition, the basic agreements with suppliers shall contain clauses on social responsibilities (compliance with Code of Conduct)) and be signed through the procurement system.\\n\\n## **Supplier Inspection Process**\\n\\n## **Managing Suppliers' Climate Actions**\\n\\nTo manage environmental information of suppliers, Samsung SDS joined the CDP's (Carbon Disclosure Project) Supply Chain Program to gather information on GHG emissions and renewable energy consumption aligned with CDP standards. As of 2023, 53 suppliers are taking part in the CDP Supply Chain Program. In addition, ESG consulting carried out guides on calculating GHG emissions to strengthen the GHG management of suppliers. Along with training on GHG mitigation awareness, GHG calculations will be performed at selected key suppliers in 2024 to identify best practices and continuously cascade to other suppliers.\\n\\n77\\n\\n## **ESG for Suppliers**\\n\\n## **Supply Chain ESG**\\n\\n## **Supply Chain ESG Evaluation**\\n\\n## **Evaluation Process**\\n\\nSamsung SDS evaluates suppliers through a systematic process of planning, execution, assessment, and planning and monitoring improvements.

As the threat of attacks on backup systems has increased recently, detailed security guides and checklists for backup systems have been prepared and distributed. Accordingly, periodic inspections are conducted for each business division to ensure that security levels such as access control and authorization management for backup system administration accounts, network configuration, and log management are being managed at a level similar to that of the operating system. In 2023, the inspection scope for backup servers was expanded from domestic business sites to backup systems of overseas subsidiaries, and the found vulnerabilities were fixed.\\n\\n## **Business Continuity Plan for Systems**\\n\\nWe have established and operated 'Business Continuity Management' guidelines with common standards for preparing against natural disasters and security incidents that can occur despite various prevention management activities. A department dedicated to disaster and accident prevention and response has been formed, and the person in charge of each system establishes a business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems, we establish detailed processes for establishing and operating a DR center and manage implementation status. To determine whether the business continuity plan established by each service is appropriate, mock training is conducted at least once a half term for each department for infringement accidents, personal information leakage accidents, or disasters. The plan is supplemented if necessary according to the results to prepare minimizing the impact in the event of an actual accident or disaster.

The Corporate Information Security Department also reviews security incidents and process improvements to revise the 'security incident response' guideline twice a year, once in the first half and once in the second half of the year, to ensure effective response systems are in pace to address potential incidents.\\n\\n## **Status of Information Security**\\n\\n|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------|------|------|------|\\n| Category                                                                                                   | Unit        | 2021 | 2022 | 2023 |\\n| Information security breach or cyber security incidents                                                    | Cases       |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n| Total number of data leak incidents                                                                        | Cases       |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n| Total number of customers affected by data leaks                                                           | Persons     |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n| Total amount of fines or penalties paid due to information  security breaches and cyber security incidents | KRW million |    0 |    0 |    0 |\\n\\n120\\n\\n## **Information Security**\\n\\n## **Raising Awareness on Security**\\n\\n## **Information Security Training**\"),\n",

As the threat of attacks on backup systems has increased recently, detailed security guides and checklists for backup systems have been prepared and distributed. Accordingly, periodic inspections are conducted for each business division to ensure that security levels such as access control and authorization management for backup system administration accounts, network configuration, and log management are being managed at a level similar to that of the operating system. In 2023, the inspection scope for backup servers was expanded from domestic business sites to backup systems of overseas subsidiaries, and the found vulnerabilities were fixed.\\n\\n## **Business Continuity Plan for Systems**\\n\\nWe have established and operated 'Business Continuity Management' guidelines with common standards for preparing against natural disasters and security incidents that can occur despite various prevention management activities. A department dedicated to disaster and accident prevention and response has been formed, and the person in charge of each system establishes a business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems, we establish detailed processes for establishing and operating a DR center and manage implementation status. To determine whether the business continuity plan established by each service is appropriate, mock training is conducted at least once a half term for each department for infringement accidents, personal information leakage accidents, or disasters. The plan is supplemented if necessary according to the results to prepare minimizing the impact in the event of an actual accident or disaster. In particular, considering that the DMZ zone system, which is open to the Internet, has a high impact in the event of an accident, the effectiveness of the applied security control items is also verified through mock control training.

The scope of the analysis includes 30 assets including global data centers (owned and leased) and the headquarter and subsidiary offices. In line with the RCP scenario in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, annual average asset value loss rates and loss values were measured for the shortterm (2024), mid-term (2025~2029), and long-term (2030~2050), and each asset's exposure to 8 climate risks including urban flooding and extreme temperatures were identified.\\n\\nThrough the analysis, loss rates for assets under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has the highest climate risks, was forecast at 4.9% in 2030 and 7.3% in 2050. These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.\\n\\nTop 5 Asset Types by Asset Value\\n\\nData Center - Owner/Occupier : $1,472m, Data Center-Tenant : $71m, Office - Tenant : $36m\\n\\nMAAL (Modeled Average Annual Loss): Estimated losses and loss ratio compared to current asset value, including operating costs, capital costs incurred due to loss rates, and costs due to business disruptions as losses\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n48\\n\\n## **SPECIAL SECTION**\\n\\n## **CLIMATE REPORT**\\n\\n## **Strategy & Business Model**\\n\\n## **Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario**\\n\\nManaging the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.\\n\\nOf the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.\"),\n",

In addition, transactions between directors and the company are restricted and directors who have an interest in a BOD resolution are prohibited from exercising their voting rights in order to minimize conflicts of interest. We form a pool of candidates by examining factors such as qualifications, business experience, and interests with the company to ensure fairness and independence in the appointment of directors while the BOD and Independent Director Recommendation Committee comprehensively consider evaluation criteria for individual candidates including expertise, social recognition, and integrity along with Board diversity, and the business environment at the time of appointment to select candidates. In addition, the Independent Director Recommendation Committee will meet once a year from 2024 onward to reinforce operations. This year, the committee meet on April 25 with all of its members attending to review candidates and discuss the direction for committee operations going forward.\\n\\n## **Board Diversity and Expertise**\\n\\nSamsung SDS composes its BOD with directors who have diverse expertise to enable strategic decision-makings from a comprehensive perspective.

Moreover, we expect to save KRW 400 million/MW in annual operating costs compared to conventional cooling.\\n\\nContinuing to expand adoption of new technologies for low-power and high-efficiency data center operations, we will deliver ESG values to customers through an eco-cloud in the long-term.\\n\\n## **Immersive Liquid Cooling**\\n\\nA next-generation cooling solution to efficiently cool heated IT equipment where IT equipment are immersed in a special electrically non-conductive fluid to cool down without requiring an additional cooling device\\n\\n21\\n\\nSustainability Management Governance\\n\\nSustainability Management Strategy\\n\\nSustainability Management Key Performance\\n\\n## **Sustainability Management Strategy**'),\n",

However, it is very difficult to quantify the short-, mid-, and long-term financial impacts of the low-carbon solutions defined by Samsung SDS and to conduct analysis of climate scenarios. This is because the data and research results required for reliable analysis have not been sufficiently accumulated, and the analysis methodology has not been established.

By doing so, we plan to go beyond local supply chains in the regions where we do business simply complying with local laws and regulations and support building an environmentally and socially sustainable system.\\n\\n## **Build a Digital Responsibility Management System**\\n\\nThe advance of cutting-edge IT technology makes life more convenient, but it also comes with strings attached. The spread of generative AI is especially grabbing attention as new issues such as deepfake technology and leak of personal information emerge. Samsung SDS is actively responding to such trends by defining AI ethics, personal information security, and open source policies as the three key pillars of the company's digital responsibility. We aim to fulfill our corporate social responsibility as an IT company by protecting our customers and stakeholders from various risks and issues caused by the introduction of new technology.\\n\\n## **Performance and Next Steps**\\n\\nRecently, the emergence of generative AI is triggering various social issues. In 2023, Samsung SDS launched a case study on AI governance systems and formed a company-wide digital responsibility task force. Following such efforts, we are currently building an AI governance system that reflects the 2024 international standards, best practices, and recommendations from global initiatives. Based on this system, we plan to apply an inspection system across the entire AI business lifecycle starting in 2025 and gradually expand it to our overseas subsidiaries in 2026. Through this, we will carry out rigorous review of the various risks that may be caused by the products and services provided by Samsung SDS.\\n\\n26\\n\\nSustainability Management Governance\\n\\nSustainability Management Strategy\\n\\nSustainability Management Key Performance\\n\\n## **Sustainability Management Strategy**\"),\n",

The RE:DUCE campaign promotes use of personal cups at the company cafes which consume 600 thousand disposable goods a year in order to reduce overall use of disposable goods within the company. Following the campaign, average daily usage of personal cups by employees increased by 5-fold, and plastic straws were replaced with biodegradable straws which also helped lower use of disposable products.\\n\\n## **ZERO Disposables Challenge**\\n\\nTaking part in the 'ZERO Disposables Challenge' promoted by the Ministry of Environment, Samsung SDS CEO delivered a message on practicing eco-friendly management and reducing use of disposable products. We will continue to spearhead efforts in environmental management through such challenges based on our ESG slogan.\\n\\n## **Paperless Campaign**\"),\n",

We define essential control items that are applied by system archetype and conduct regular reviews to maintain a high level of security and safety.\\n\\n## **Risk Management**\\n\\nThe Information Security Department identifies potential security risks by analyzing the internal and external environment and internal security inspection results, and determines their impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability losses regarding all of our information assets. Based on the impact analysis, a risk assessment is carried out at least once a year to analyze security vulnerabilities for each information asset type. We manage the identified risks through a process where strategies and protection measures are selected with relevant departments and officers, and implementation plans are built and reported to management to confirm whether measures are taken. During risk assessments in the following year, mitigation of risks identified in the previous year are reassessed which is included in the Risk Assessment Report submitted each year for external certification and audits on information security practices for objective evaluation. In 2023, 10 risks were identified, and actions have been completed based on the protection measures which have been reflected in the information security management system.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\n119'),\n",

At the 39th General Shareholders' Meeting in March 2024, one independent director and two executive directors were appointed, following recommendations from the Independent Director Recommendation Committee and BOD with the appointment process for each director conducted in accordance with relevant laws. In order to enhance efficiency in BOD operations and decision-makings, President Sungwoo Hwang was reappointed as CEO and BOD Chair through Board resolution in accordance with Article 33 of the Articles of Incorporation and Article 5 of the BOD Regulations. In addition, efforts have been made continuously to strengthen accountable management led by the Board such as introducing the senior independent director system in October 2023. Currently, the BOD is composed of 3 executive directors and 4 independent directors which is pursuant to Article 542-8 of the Commercial Act that stipulates that there should be 3 or more outside directors with the number of outside directors making up the majority of directors.\\n\\n## **Senior Independent Director**\\n\\nThe senior(lead) independent director system, mandated at financial firms such as banks, provides checks and balances by appointing a senior independent director to represent independent directors at boards where the CEO or executive director is chair. Samsung SDS is not subject to this mandatory rule as it is not a financial firm but adopted the senior independent director system in October 2023 to strengthen BOD independence and governance transparency and appointed Hyun-Han Shin as the senior independent director.

A customized dashboard is provided to each of our customers, allowing emissions in the supply chain to be monitored immediately for control to support customers in managing emissions effectively throughout the logistics process.\\n\\nThe dashboard gives customers complete visibility into the emissions of all transport modes in the supply chain. This includes not only international routes, but also local routes and even emissions from logistics centers. Moreover, various types of analyses are supported such as carbon emissions and intensity, monthly and annual emissions trends, and information on top emission routes. This way, customers can manage emissions more efficiently across periods, routes, and transport modes associated with high carbon emissions.\\n\\n## **Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System**\\n\\nWe set up the Cello Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System to manage emissions systematically across the 200 logistics centers operating in 35 countries worldwide. Previously, only emissions from transportation means such as air and sea transport could be monitored, but services have been extended to logistics centers to enable customers to view emissions across the entire logistics process. Based on data such as operating periods, area utilized, and electricity usage, emission factors of each country are incorporated to calculate real-time emissions on a monthly basis.\\n\\nSamsung SDS will continue to provide eco-friendly values to customers by expanding its cloud and logistics services.\\n\\n23\\n\\nSustainability Management Governance\\n\\nSustainability Management Strategy\\n\\nSustainability Management Key Performance\\n\\n## **Sustainability Management Strategy**\\n\\n## **ENVIRONMENTAL**\\n\\n## **ESG Data Management based on an ESG Platform**\\n\\n## **ESG Value Delivery System**'),\n",

Each business unit has its own compliance officer and manager who carry out autonomous compliance activities (320 specialists as of March 2024). The Compliance team manages risks in key areas such as anti-corruption, fair trade, subcontracting, business regulations, data privacy, and intellectual property, among others, together with relevant departments.\\n\\n## **Compliance Management Organization**\\n\\nKey Areas Managed\\n\\n## **Samsung Compliance Committee**\\n\\nSamsung SDS participated in the first Samsung Compliance Committee in January 2020, alongside seven other major Samsung companies, to prevent unlawful acts by top management and enhance compliance monitoring. In January 2024, the appointment of the chairman and members of the third Samsung Compliance Committee was approved through a board of directors resolution. The Samsung Compliance Committee directly examines matters such as external sponsorship expenses and internal transactions and may present opinions to the board of directors. The committee also periodically receives reports on Samsung SDS's compliance monitoring program and recommends improvements to ensure its effectiveness.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n## **Compliance Management Regulations and Processes**\\n\\nBased on its business principles, Samsung SDS establishes a Code of Conduct Guideline and detailed policies on fair trade and anti-corruption to comply with legal and ethical standards and fulfill its corporate social responsibilities. In addition, compliance standards enacted through BOD resolution and operating regulations are also provided along with specific guidelines for each situation to make compliance easy to understand when carrying out duties.

We manage the identified risks through a process where strategies and protection measures are selected with relevant departments and officers, and implementation plans are built and reported to management to confirm whether measures are taken. During risk assessments in the following year, mitigation of risks identified in the previous year are reassessed which is included in the Risk Assessment Report submitted each year for external certification and audits on information security practices for objective evaluation. In 2023, 10 risks were identified, and actions have been completed based on the protection measures which have been reflected in the information security management system.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\n119'),\n",

The system requires conversions between AC and DC to switch between charging and discharging as UPS receives power supply from batteries in the event of power outages or voltage drops. The Suwon Data Center replaced its outdated UPS system with a modular high-efficiency UPS and old lead acid batteries with high-durability lithium-ion batteries to minimize the massive amount of electrical energy being lost in the form of heat energy during the conversion. Introduction of the high-efficiency UPS was found to have improved overall performance by around 10%, reducing approximately 565 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Transformers**\\n\\nWhile extra high-voltage power is supplied to data centers to support their massive use of energy, transformers are needed to step down the voltages and make necessary adjustments to be used by IT equipment and other facilities. The Suwon Data Center used oil-filled transformers with insulating oil that serve as insulators and coolants but switched to mold transformers that use epoxy resin for insulation and cooling. Mold transformers are space efficient, allowing for high-efficiency designs within same volume areas. The replacement resulted in 304 tons of GHG emission reductions.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n## **Cooling Towers**'),\n",

This system allows for appropriate balance and checks by appointing a senior independent director to represent independent directors when the CEO or an executive director serves as BOD Chair, and Hyun-Han Shin was selected as our first senior independent director. The senior independent director can arrange and convene meetings among the independent directors and supports communication between outside directors and the BOD Chair and members of management.

In particular, in the case of policy risks, we conducted a scenario analysis using S&P Global's methodology to increase the reliability of the analysis. First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts. Market risks were calculated by assessing the cost of switching to renewable energy in the power sector through analysis of the supply price of renewable energy, while reputational risks were analyzed based on the financial impact on revenues resulting from increased negative stakeholder feedback due to inadequate climate-related disclosure and greenwashing.\"),\n",

GHG emissions at Samsung SDS are projected to continue to increase as our business grows which can trigger a severe climate risk. Acknowledging the importance of the environment, Samsung SDS implements and operates data centers equipped with the latest energy mitigation technologies to reduce this climate risk. Moreover, we plan to make a 100% transition to renewable energy by expanding solar power generation facilities and making REC purchases. In particular, we are disclosing not only emissions for domestic upstream transportation, but also our Scope 3 emissions that include global transportation to taken a preemptive response across the entire value chain as supply chain management including Scope 3 emissions becomes more important than before.\\n\\n## **Scope 1, 2 GHG Emissions**\\n\\n|----------------------------|-------------|---------|---------|---------|---------|\\n| Category                   | Unit        | 2021    | 2022    | 2023    | Target  |\\n| Total Scope 1, 2 emissions | tCO$_{2}$eq | 101,882 | 122,842 | 166,046 | 171,324 |\\n| Scope 1                    | tCO$_{2}$eq | 3,354   | 4,539   | 6,252   | 5,551   |\\n| Scope 2                    | tCO$_{2}$eq | 98,528  | 118,308 | 159,799 | 165,773 |\\n\\n## **Cause of Emissions Increase in 2023**\\n\\n- Dongtan Data Center (Sep 2022~)\\n\\n- Pangyo IT Campus (Jun 2022~)\\n\\n- Suwon, Sangam, Chuncheon Data Centers - Increase in AI and semiconductor related GPU servers\\n\\n## **Scope 3 GHG Emissions**\"),\n",

In particular, in the case of policy risks, we conducted a scenario analysis using S&P Global's methodology to increase the reliability of the analysis. First, we comprehensively analyzed data from more than 100 countries, such as carbon taxes, emissions trading schemes, and fuel prices to draw out carbon prices. We applied the 'Trucost CEaR' scenario based on the results of the global carbon cost estimation study linked to the 2°C scenario to predict changes in carbon prices and calculate the carbon cost that Samsung SDS did not reflect. In the end, we analyzed the financial impact of future carbon costs by considering future carbon emissions based on our own analysis of Samsung SDS' carbon emission trends and business plans. We also identify and manage the financial impact of the technical, market, and reputational risks related to climate change on Samsung SDS. For technical risks, the financial impact triggered by cost burdens and failed investments in new technologies to apply low-power at data centers was identified by looking at the technology investment costs, data center's potential emissions, and carbon price forecasts.

Samsung SDS is the only Korean company to have obtained the highest certification grade since the certification program was launched in 2009. High quality software processes imply that the entire software development process is consistent from beginning to end and is being continuously improved to offer better services. The granted SP certification grade is the result of assessment of project activities executed by the given company with Grade 2 meaning project management, development, and support areas meet industry standards. Grade 3, however, requires organization management and process improvements to be carried out, as well. Grade 2 assessments review project management (planning, control, and supplier management), development (specification management, analysis, design, deployment, and testing), and support (quality assurance, configuration management, measurement and analysis), and Grade 3 assessments include organization management (organization process management, member training) and process improvements (organizational performance management, problem-solving, process improvement management).

The scope of the analysis includes 30 assets including global data centers (owned and leased) and the headquarter and subsidiary offices. In line with the RCP scenario in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, annual average asset value loss rates and loss values were measured for the shortterm (2024), mid-term (2025~2029), and long-term (2030~2050), and each asset's exposure to 8 climate risks including urban flooding and extreme temperatures were identified.\\n\\nThrough the analysis, loss rates for assets under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has the highest climate risks, was forecast at 4.9% in 2030 and 7.3% in 2050. These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.\\n\\nTop 5 Asset Types by Asset Value\\n\\nData Center - Owner/Occupier : $1,472m, Data Center-Tenant : $71m, Office - Tenant : $36m\\n\\nMAAL (Modeled Average Annual Loss): Estimated losses and loss ratio compared to current asset value, including operating costs, capital costs incurred due to loss rates, and costs due to business disruptions as losses\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n48\\n\\n## **SPECIAL SECTION**\\n\\n## **CLIMATE REPORT**\\n\\n## **Strategy & Business Model**\\n\\n## **Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario**\\n\\nManaging the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.\\n\\nOf the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.\"),\n",

As the threat of attacks on backup systems has increased recently, detailed security guides and checklists for backup systems have been prepared and distributed. Accordingly, periodic inspections are conducted for each business division to ensure that security levels such as access control and authorization management for backup system administration accounts, network configuration, and log management are being managed at a level similar to that of the operating system. In 2023, the inspection scope for backup servers was expanded from domestic business sites to backup systems of overseas subsidiaries, and the found vulnerabilities were fixed.\\n\\n## **Business Continuity Plan for Systems**\\n\\nWe have established and operated 'Business Continuity Management' guidelines with common standards for preparing against natural disasters and security incidents that can occur despite various prevention management activities. A department dedicated to disaster and accident prevention and response has been formed, and the person in charge of each system establishes a business continuity plan. In the case of critical systems, we establish detailed processes for establishing and operating a DR center and manage implementation status. To determine whether the business continuity plan established by each service is appropriate, mock training is conducted at least once a half term for each department for infringement accidents, personal information leakage accidents, or disasters. The plan is supplemented if necessary according to the results to prepare minimizing the impact in the event of an actual accident or disaster. In particular, considering that the DMZ zone system, which is open to the Internet, has a high impact in the event of an accident, the effectiveness of the applied security control items is also verified through mock control training. In 2023, web shell attacks were conducted for 31 services in the first and second half of the year, and the response process was improved by analyzing the results.\\n\\nINTRODUCTION\\n\\nSUSTAINABILITY MANAGEMENT\\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL GOVERNANCE\"),\n",

The scope of the analysis includes 30 assets including global data centers (owned and leased) and the headquarter and subsidiary offices. In line with the RCP scenario in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, annual average asset value loss rates and loss values were measured for the shortterm (2024), mid-term (2025~2029), and long-term (2030~2050), and each asset's exposure to 8 climate risks including urban flooding and extreme temperatures were identified.\\n\\nThrough the analysis, loss rates for assets under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has the highest climate risks, was forecast at 4.9% in 2030 and 7.3% in 2050. These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.\\n\\nTop 5 Asset Types by Asset Value\\n\\nData Center - Owner/Occupier : $1,472m, Data Center-Tenant : $71m, Office - Tenant : $36m\\n\\nMAAL (Modeled Average Annual Loss): Estimated losses and loss ratio compared to current asset value, including operating costs, capital costs incurred due to loss rates, and costs due to business disruptions as losses\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n48\\n\\n## **SPECIAL SECTION**\\n\\n## **CLIMATE REPORT**\\n\\n## **Strategy & Business Model**\\n\\n## **Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario**\\n\\nManaging the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.\\n\\nOf the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.\"),\n",

However, it is very difficult to quantify the short-, mid-, and long-term financial impacts of the low-carbon solutions defined by Samsung SDS and to conduct analysis of climate scenarios. This is because the data and research results required for reliable analysis have not been sufficiently accumulated, and the analysis methodology has not been established.

The scope of the analysis includes 30 assets including global data centers (owned and leased) and the headquarter and subsidiary offices. In line with the RCP scenario in the IPCC 5th Assessment Report, annual average asset value loss rates and loss values were measured for the shortterm (2024), mid-term (2025~2029), and long-term (2030~2050), and each asset's exposure to 8 climate risks including urban flooding and extreme temperatures were identified.\\n\\nThrough the analysis, loss rates for assets under the RCP 8.5 scenario, which has the highest climate risks, was forecast at 4.9% in 2030 and 7.3% in 2050. These figures are 18.0%~33.0%p lower than measurements of the RCP 8.5 scenario in 2022 which showed 22.9% in 2030 and 40.3% in 2050, resulting from use of more advanced S&P methodologies with improved resolution.\\n\\nTop 5 Asset Types by Asset Value\\n\\nData Center - Owner/Occupier : $1,472m, Data Center-Tenant : $71m, Office - Tenant : $36m\\n\\nMAAL (Modeled Average Annual Loss): Estimated losses and loss ratio compared to current asset value, including operating costs, capital costs incurred due to loss rates, and costs due to business disruptions as losses\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL\\n\\nSOCIAL GOVERNANCE\\n\\n48\\n\\n## **SPECIAL SECTION**\\n\\n## **CLIMATE REPORT**\\n\\n## **Strategy & Business Model**\\n\\n## **Analysis of Physical Risk Scenario**\\n\\nManaging the physical risks of Samsung SDS' key assets and its data centers is imperative to the business. To this end, we divided the risk rating and defined material physical risks to identify which data centers were exposed to these risks and when. There were no data centers exposed to material physical risks in the short-term, but the Shanghai Data Center is expected to reach Medium-High risk levels in the mid-term. In the long-term which starts in 2030, the Dallas Data Center also has possibility of being exposed to material risks, so we plan to continuously monitor physical risks and prepare countermeasures to minimize asset losses.\\n\\nOf the 8 climate risks, extreme temperatures has the most significant impact on asset losses while urban flooding is also projected to have somewhat impact. Other risks such as coastal flooding, wildfires, tropical cyclones, water stress, and river flooding were found to cause either little or no losses. Moreover, we plan to mitigate the risks of extreme temperatures by increasing cooling facilities, replacing outdated equipment, and applying liquid cooling, etc. to data centers.\"),\n",

Based on the standards, ESG levels of suppliers are checked through a systematic process that includes receiving compliance agreements to the Code of Conduct, self-inspections, site inspections, and third-party assurance (operations) to make necessary improvements and strengthen capabilities (follow-up). In addition, the basic agreements with suppliers shall contain clauses on social responsibilities (compliance with Code of Conduct)) and be signed through the procurement system.\\n\\n## **Supplier Inspection Process**\\n\\n## **Managing Suppliers' Climate Actions**\\n\\nTo manage environmental information of suppliers, Samsung SDS joined the CDP's (Carbon Disclosure Project) Supply Chain Program to gather information on GHG emissions and renewable energy consumption aligned with CDP standards. As of 2023, 53 suppliers are taking part in the CDP Supply Chain Program. In addition, ESG consulting carried out guides on calculating GHG emissions to strengthen the GHG management of suppliers. Along with training on GHG mitigation awareness, GHG calculations will be performed at selected key suppliers in 2024 to identify best practices and continuously cascade to other suppliers.\\n\\n77\\n\\n## **ESG for Suppliers**\\n\\n## **Supply Chain ESG**\\n\\n## **Supply Chain ESG Evaluation**\\n\\n## **Evaluation Process**\\n\\nSamsung SDS evaluates suppliers through a systematic process of planning, execution, assessment, and planning and monitoring improvements.

As part of our corporate information security policies, we have a 'Security Incident Response' guideline that defines response and follow-up measures for incidents classified based on degree of impact with specific procedures being developed and operated by the Incident Response Department. In the event of a security incident, the dedicated department quickly forward the case to relevant departments to minimize impact while material incidents are reported to management to ensure there are no issues in the response measures taken. Afterwards, the cause of the incident is analyzed, and preventive measures are devised along with a review of the response process to incorporate necessary improvements going forward.

In addition, we assessed the suitability of our economic activities and calculated the net sales, CAPEX, and OPEX ratios of activities that contribute to climate change mitigation based on the EU Taxonomy standards. However, it is very difficult to quantify the short-, mid-, and long-term financial impacts of the low-carbon solutions defined by Samsung SDS and to conduct analysis of climate scenarios. This is because the data and research results required for reliable analysis have not been sufficiently accumulated, and the analysis methodology has not been established.

Based on the impact analysis, a risk assessment is carried out at least once a year to analyze security vulnerabilities for each information asset type. We manage the identified risks through a process where strategies and protection measures are selected with relevant departments and officers, and implementation plans are built and reported to management to confirm whether measures are taken.

Previous closed-type chillers isolate cooling liquids from the atmosphere and has an advantage in terms of being less affected by external contamination. However, such closed-type cooling towers use brines (EG solutions) to prevent freezing in the winter which requires a separate process for discharging or disposal to prevent environmental pollution, as well as an additional feed water pump that results in more energy consumption than open-type cooling towers. The Suwon Data Center replaced its closed-type cooling towers with high-efficiency open-types that can be controlled based on cooling loads and reduced around 952 tons of GHG emissions.\\n\\n## **Temperature and Humidity Chambers**\\n\\nMost of the electrical energy used by IT equipment in computing is emitted as heat energy which is why large capacity cooling facilities are essential at data centers.

Based on the impact analysis, a risk assessment is carried out at least once a year to analyze security vulnerabilities for each information asset type. We manage the identified risks through a process where strategies and protection measures are selected with relevant departments and officers, and implementation plans are built and reported to management to confirm whether measures are taken. During risk assessments in the following year, mitigation of risks identified in the previous year are reassessed which is included in the Risk Assessment Report submitted each year for external certification and audits on information security practices for objective evaluation. In 2023, 10 risks were identified, and actions have been completed based on the protection measures which have been reflected in the information security management system.\\n\\nENVIRONMENTAL SOCIAL\\n\\nGOVERNANCE\\n\\n119'),\n",

Cello manages transport data across all routes used to calculate emissions, securing reliability in calculations by utilizing EcoTransIT. A customized dashboard is provided to each of our customers, allowing emissions in the supply chain to be monitored immediately for control to support customers in managing emissions effectively throughout the logistics process.\\n\\nThe dashboard gives customers complete visibility into the emissions of all transport modes in the supply chain. This includes not only international routes, but also local routes and even emissions from logistics centers. Moreover, various types of analyses are supported such as carbon emissions and intensity, monthly and annual emissions trends, and information on top emission routes. This way, customers can manage emissions more efficiently across periods, routes, and transport modes associated with high carbon emissions.\\n\\n## **Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System**\\n\\nWe set up the Cello Logistics Center Carbon Emissions Monitoring System to manage emissions systematically across the 200 logistics centers operating in 35 countries worldwide. Previously, only emissions from transportation means such as air and sea transport could be monitored, but services have been extended to logistics centers to enable customers to view emissions across the entire logistics process. Based on data such as operating periods, area utilized, and electricity usage, emission factors of each country are incorporated to calculate real-time emissions on a monthly basis.\\n\\nSamsung SDS will continue to provide eco-friendly values to customers by expanding its cloud and logistics services.\\n\\n23\\n\\nSustainability Management Governance\\n\\nSustainability Management Strategy\\n\\nSustainability Management Key Performance\\n\\n## **Sustainability Management Strategy**\\n\\n## **ENVIRONMENTAL**\\n\\n## **ESG Data Management based on an ESG Platform**\\n\\n## **ESG Value Delivery System**'),\n",
